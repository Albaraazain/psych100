            "correct": "Classical conditioning produces involuntary, automatic responses (like salivation, fear, or other reflexes). The organism doesn't choose to respond. Operant conditioning shapes voluntary, emitted behaviors that the organism controls (like pressing a lever or studying).",

            "correct": "Biological preparedness suggests organisms are predisposed to fear stimuli that posed evolutionary threats to our ancestors. Snakes were dangerous throughout human evolutionary history, so fear of snakes is easily acquired, strongly maintained, and resistant to extinction. Öhman et al. (1975) showed humans easily conditioned to fear snakes but not flowers or houses.",

            "correct": "Variable-ratio schedules (reinforcement after unpredictable number of responses) produce the strongest resistance to extinction.

              "Continuous reinforcement": "Continuous reinforcement (every response rewarded) produces the quickest extinction. The organism immediately notices when rewards stop because they're used to consistent reinforcement.",
