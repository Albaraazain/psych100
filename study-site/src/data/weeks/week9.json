            "correct": "This is a classic age-related pattern: crystallized intelligence (learned knowledge like vocabulary and familiar problem-solving) remains stable or increases with age, while fluid intelligence (novel problem-solving) declines. The professor's extensive knowledge is intact but novel reasoning has declined.",
            "incorrect": {
              "High fluid intelligence, declining crystallized intelligence": "This is backwards. Vocabulary and familiar problem-solving reflect crystallized intelligence, which is intact. Her struggle with novel puzzles shows declining fluid intelligence.",

              "Practical intelligence": "Practical intelligence ('street smarts') involves adapting to real-world situations. Traditional IQ tests don't assess this—they use abstract, decontextualized problems.",

              "Intrapersonal intelligence": "This is about understanding YOURSELF—self-awareness and insight into your own emotions and motivations, not understanding others.",

          "explanation": {
            "correct": "The main criticism is that Gardner's 'intelligences' may be better described as talents or abilities rather than truly independent forms of intelligence. There's limited empirical evidence that these are separate intelligences rather than specialized skills. Additionally, many show correlations suggesting an underlying g-factor.",
            "incorrect": {
              "It only identifies two types of intelligence": "Gardner proposed EIGHT types of intelligence, not two. Cattell's theory has two types (fluid and crystallized).",
              "It contradicts the existence of a g-factor completely": "While Gardner downplays g, this isn't the primary criticism. The main issue is whether his 'intelligences' are truly independent forms of intelligence or just talents.",
              "It focuses too heavily on academic abilities": "Actually, the opposite is true. Gardner's theory EXPANDED beyond academic abilities to include musical, bodily-kinesthetic, and interpersonal skills—that's one of its appeals."

            "correct": "The engineer uses analytical intelligence (problem-solving, logical reasoning, analyzing complex systems). The CEO uses practical intelligence (applying knowledge in real-world contexts, adapting to social situations, implementing ideas—'street smarts').",
            "incorrect": {
              "practical intelligence; analytical intelligence": "This reverses the match. Writing algorithms is analytical work (abstract problem-solving), while navigating politics is practical application in real contexts.",
              "creative intelligence; analytical intelligence": "While coding can involve creativity, solving complex algorithms is primarily analytical. And the CEO's skills are practical adaptation, not analytical reasoning.",
              "crystallized intelligence; fluid intelligence": "These are Cattell's concepts, not Sternberg's triarchic theory. The question asks about Sternberg's framework, and the skills described map to analytical and practical, not crystallized and fluid."

Older adults often have richer vocabularies and more world knowledge than younger adults.",

            "correct": "This is a classic Flynn Effect pattern: population-level IQ increases over time, largest on fluid intelligence tests (like Raven's Matrices), observed in developing nations. Environmental improvements (nutrition, education, cognitive stimulation) are the proposed mechanism.",
            "incorrect": {
              "Genetic evolution of the population": "Genetic evolution takes thousands of years, not 40 years. The Flynn Effect is far too rapid to be genetic evolution—it must be environmental.",
              "Test bias being reduced over time": "If test bias were being reduced, we'd expect gains primarily on culturally-loaded tests. Instead, gains are LARGEST on culture-reduced tests like Raven's, suggesting real cognitive improvements, not reduced bias.",

            "correct": "In adoption studies, children share genes with biological parents but environment with adoptive parents. This naturally separates genetic from environmental influences. When children from disadvantaged backgrounds are adopted into high-SES families and show substantial IQ gains, this demonstrates environmental impact—the genetic contribution from biological parents remains constant, so gains must be environmental.",

              "Adoptive parents are always wealthier than biological parents": "While adoptive parents are often higher-SES, this alone doesn't explain why adoption studies are better evidence. The key is the genetic-environment separation, not just SES differences.",
              "Adopted children take IQ tests more frequently": "Test frequency isn't the issue, and this isn't necessarily true. The value of adoption studies is in separating genetic from environmental contributions."
