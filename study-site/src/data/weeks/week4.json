Even if a goal is highly valued, you won't pursue it if you believe success is impossible. Even if you're confident of success, you won't pursue a goal you don't value.",

            "correct": "The overjustification effect occurs when providing external rewards for intrinsically motivated activities actually decreases intrinsic motivation. When people are paid for activities they previously enjoyed, they may reinterpret the activity as work rather than play, shifting from intrinsic to extrinsic motivation. For example, paying a child to read may reduce their natural love of reading.",

It cannot explain behaviors that increase tension (curiosity, thrill-seeking), behaviors that contradict drives (dieting), or behaviors driven by social and psychological factors. Human motivation involves cognition, emotion, social context, and personal values, not just biological homeostasis.",

            "correct": "Arousal theory explains thrill-seeking by suggesting some people have higher optimal arousal levels and need more stimulation. Skydiving increases arousal to reach this optimal level. Individual differences in optimal arousal explain why some people seek extreme activities while others prefer calm pursuits. Drive theory fails here because thrill-seeking increases tension rather than reducing it.",
            "incorrect": {

            "correct": "The TAT is criticized because cultural differences in storytelling styles can affect results. Different cultures have different narrative conventions, values regarding achievement, and comfort with expressing achievement themes.
