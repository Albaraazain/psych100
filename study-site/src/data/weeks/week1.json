It's a diverse, interdisciplinary field that uses research and experimentation to gain insights into human development, mental processes, and the biological, social, and environmental factors that influence how we think, feel, and behave."

            "correct": "There is typically a trade-off: highly controlled lab studies (high internal validity) often sacrifice real-world applicability (external validity), while naturalistic studies with high external validity may have less control over variables (lower internal validity).",
