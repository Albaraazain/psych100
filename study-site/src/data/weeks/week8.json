          "explanation": {
            "correct": "Scaffolding is help provided by someone more knowledgeable (parent, teacher, peer) within the child's ZPD. Like construction scaffolding, it's temporary and gradually removed as the child becomes capable.",

          "explanation": {
            "correct": "This perfectly illustrates scaffolding—providing maximum support initially (training wheels), gradually reducing it (holding, then running alongside), and finally removing it completely as the child becomes competent. The support is temporary and systematically withdrawn.",

            "correct": "Vygotsky emphasized that culture shapes both the content (what is learned) and process (how it's learned) of cognitive development. Different cultures provide different tools, practices, and knowledge systems, creating variation—contrasting with Piaget's universal stages.",
            "incorrect": {
              "Culture has no effect; development is universal": "This is closer to Piaget's position. Vygotsky strongly emphasized cultural influences and variation.",

          "explanation": {
            "correct": "Effective scaffolding involves gradually reducing support (fading) as the child becomes more competent, transferring responsibility from expert to learner over time. This allows the child to develop independence while preventing frustration.",
            "incorrect": {
              "Provided constantly without change": "Unchanging support prevents development of independence. Scaffolding must be gradually withdrawn.",

              "Eliminated immediately once the child shows any success": "Removing support too quickly leads to failure and frustration. Withdrawal should be gradual and responsive to competence."
