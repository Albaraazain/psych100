            "correct": "Antipsychotic drugs work by physically blocking dopamine D2 receptors in the brain. Here's what happens step-by-step:\n\n1. **Normal state:** Dopamine is released from sending neurons and binds to D2 receptors on receiving neurons\n2. **In psychosis:** There's excessive dopamine activity in the mesolimbic pathway (a specific brain circuit running from midbrain to limbic system)\n3. **What the drug does:** Antipsychotic molecules sit in the D2 receptor slots, physically preventing dopamine from binding\n4. **Result:** Even though dopamine is still being released, it can't activate receptors because the drug molecules are blocking the slots\n5. **Outcome:** Reduced dopamine signaling in the mesolimbic pathway → fewer hallucinations and delusions\n\n**Why positive symptoms improve but negative symptoms don't:** The drug blocks dopamine EVERYWHERE, not just where there's too much. In the prefrontal cortex (responsible for motivation, emotion), there may actually be TOO LITTLE dopamine. Blocking receptors there makes negative symptoms (flat affect, withdrawal) worse or unchanged.",

              "Increase serotonin levels": "Wrong neurotransmitter for psychosis treatment. SSRIs increase serotonin for DEPRESSION, not psychosis. Antipsychotics target DOPAMINE receptors specifically. Some newer atypical antipsychotics do affect serotonin as a secondary effect, but the primary anti-hallucination effect comes from dopamine blocking.",
              "Block GABA receptors": "GABA is an inhibitory neurotransmitter that CALMS brain activity. Blocking GABA would INCREASE neural firing, which would make psychotic symptoms WORSE. Antianxiety drugs (benzodiazepines) ENHANCE GABA, not block it. Antipsychotics work on dopamine, not GABA.",
              "Enhance norepinephrine function": "Norepinephrine enhancement is the mechanism for certain antidepressants (tricyclics, SNRIs), not antipsychotics. Norepinephrine affects alertness and mood. Antipsychotics reduce dopamine activity specifically because excessive dopamine in certain brain pathways causes hallucinations and delusions."

Serotonin is released from neuron A into the synapse (gap between neurons)\n2. Some serotonin binds to receptors on neuron B (the receiving neuron)\n3. A reuptake pump (SERT transporter) on neuron A normally vacuums serotonin back for recycling\n4. SSRIs BLOCK this reuptake pump\n5. Result: Serotonin stays in the synapse longer → more receptor activation on neuron B\n\n**Why milder side effects:** SSRIs ONLY block serotonin reuptake. Older antidepressants (tricyclics, MAOIs) affect MULTIPLE neurotransmitter systems, causing more side effects. SSRIs are \"selective\" - they target one system.\n\n**Examples:** Prozac (fluoxetine), Zoloft (sertraline), Lexapro (escitalopram)\n\n**Timeline:** Takes 2-4 weeks for full effect because the brain needs time to adjust receptor sensitivity.",

The histamine blocking causes drowsiness, dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation, and weight gain. They also affect heart rhythm. SSRIs are safer and better tolerated.",
              "MAO inhibitors": "MAO inhibitors have the MOST SEVERE side effects of any antidepressant class. They block the MAO enzyme that breaks down multiple neurotransmitters. The dangerous problem: tyramine in foods (aged cheese, wine, fermented foods) isn't broken down properly, causing potentially fatal spikes in blood pressure (hypertensive crisis). Patients must follow strict dietary restrictions. Used only when other treatments fail.",

The underlying patterns remain.\n\n**This is why combination treatment (medication + therapy) often works best:** Medication reduces symptoms enough to function, while therapy builds lasting skills.",

Client describes the dream in detail\n2. Client free-associates to elements of the dream (\"What comes to mind when you think of water?\")\n3. Therapist looks for patterns and connections to the client's life\n4. Interpretation: \"You dream of drowning when you feel overwhelmed at work. The water might represent the demands that feel like they're engulfing you.\"\n\n**Why other approaches wouldn't do this:**\n- Behaviorists don't interpret - they'd focus on reducing the nightmare behavior\n- Cognitive therapists might explore thoughts ABOUT the nightmare, but not symbolic meaning\n- Biological approaches might prescribe medication for sleep disturbance",

Patient is given anesthesia (unconscious) and a muscle relaxant (prevents convulsions from causing injury)\n2. Electrodes placed on scalp\n3. Brief electrical current (less than 1 second) passes through brain\n4. This induces a controlled seizure in the central nervous system (about 30-60 seconds)\n5. Patient wakes up, typically with temporary confusion\n\n**Why ECT is used for severe depression with suicide risk:**\n- **Speed:** Effects can be IMMEDIATE - within days. Medications take 2-4 WEEKS\n- **When waiting is dangerous:** A suicidal patient can't safely wait weeks for medication to work\n- **When medications fail:** ECT is tried after multiple medications haven't worked\n\n**The mechanism is unknown:**\nWe know ECT works for severe depression, but we don't know exactly WHY inducing a seizure helps.

          "explanation": {
            "correct": "Benzodiazepines work by boosting the effects of GABA, the brain's main inhibitory neurotransmitter.\n\n**Step-by-step mechanism:**\n\n1. **GABA normally does:** When GABA binds to GABA-A receptors, it opens chloride channels, letting negative ions into the neuron. This makes the neuron LESS likely to fire (inhibition = calming effect).\n\n2. **What benzodiazepines do:** They bind to a special site on the GABA-A receptor (not the same site where GABA binds)\n\n3. **Effect:** When a benzodiazepine is attached, GABA binds MORE EFFECTIVELY. The chloride channel opens more, allowing more negative ions in.\n\n4. **Result:** MORE inhibition → neurons fire less → reduced neural activity → calming, anti-anxiety effect\n\n**Examples:** Valium (diazepam), Xanax (alprazolam), Ativan (lorazepam)\n\n**Side effects from enhancing GABA:**\n- Drowsiness (too much calming)\n- Impaired coordination\n- Risk of dependence (brain adapts to the drug being there)",

The person learns this BEFORE starting exposure.\n\n**Component 3: Pairing relaxation with feared imagery/situations**\nWhile maintaining relaxation, the person imagines (or faces) the feared situation. Starting low on the hierarchy, only moving up when no anxiety is felt at the current level.\n\n**Why it works (the mechanism):**\nRelaxation and anxiety are incompatible - your body can't be deeply relaxed AND anxious at the same time (reciprocal inhibition). By repeatedly experiencing the feared stimulus while relaxed, the brain learns a new association: feared object = calm, not feared object = panic.\n\nThis is COUNTERCONDITIONING - replacing one conditioned response (fear) with an opposite one (relaxation).",

          "explanation": {
            "correct": "Flooding involves IMMEDIATE, INTENSE exposure to the most feared stimulus until anxiety naturally decreases (extinction). This can be faster than gradual systematic desensitization but is much more distressing because the patient faces maximum fear immediately. Systematic desensitization is gentler but takes longer to work through the hierarchy.",
            "incorrect": {
              "Systematic desensitization—it uses relaxation so patients progress quickly": "Relaxation makes the process more comfortable but not faster. Gradual progression through a fear hierarchy takes more time than immediate intense exposure.",
              "Both take exactly the same amount of time": "Research shows flooding typically produces faster results because it's immediate rather than gradual. The trade-off is increased distress during treatment.",
              "Neither works for phobias—only medication is effective": "Both exposure therapies are highly effective for phobias—often more effective than medication. Behavioral treatments are first-line for specific phobias."

            "correct": "Aversion therapy pairs two stimuli (alcohol + nausea) to create a conditioned response—this is CLASSICAL conditioning (Pavlovian). Token economy provides rewards after desired behaviors to increase them—this is OPERANT conditioning (consequences shape behavior). Different behavioral techniques use different conditioning principles.",

            "correct": "In classical conditioning, the nausea-inducing drug naturally causes nausea (unconditioned stimulus → unconditioned response). Alcohol is initially neutral regarding nausea. After pairing, alcohol becomes the conditioned stimulus that triggers conditioned nausea/aversion. The alcohol is CONDITIONED to produce the response; nausea is UNCONDITIONED (natural).",
            "incorrect": {

          "explanation": {
            "correct": "IMMEDIACY of reinforcement is crucial. When reinforcement is delayed (weekly vs. immediately after behavior), the connection between behavior and consequence weakens. The token should be given RIGHT AFTER the desired behavior so the person clearly links their action to the reward. Weekly distribution breaks this contingency.",
