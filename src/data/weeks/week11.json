        "Humanistic therapies (Carl Rogers) emphasize unconditional positive regard, empathy, and genuineness in person-centered therapy.",

            "correct": "Antipsychotic drugs work by decreasing the action of dopamine in the brain. This is based on the dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia, which suggests that excessive dopamine activity contributes to positive symptoms like hallucinations and delusions. By blocking dopamine receptors, these medications reduce these symptoms.",
            "incorrect": {
              "Increase serotonin levels": "While some newer atypical antipsychotics do affect serotonin, the primary mechanism for treating psychotic symptoms is dopamine reduction, not serotonin increase. SSRIs increase serotonin for depression, not psychosis.",
              "Block GABA receptors": "GABA is an inhibitory neurotransmitter. Blocking GABA would increase neural activity, which would worsen psychotic symptoms rather than improve them. Antianxiety drugs enhance GABA, but antipsychotics work on dopamine.",

While medications can effectively manage symptoms, they don't teach patients how to cope with stress, solve problems, or develop healthy thought patterns. This is why combining medication with psychotherapy often produces better long-term outcomes—therapy provides skills that medications cannot.",

              "Teaching the person to challenge irrational beliefs about drinking": "This describes cognitive therapy or CBT, which focuses on changing thoughts and beliefs.

Some medications do have effects beyond placebo, but the placebo contribution is larger than often recognized.",

The placebo effect is well-documented across all medical treatments. This criticism is about overestimating drug-specific effects, not about fraudulent claims.",
              "Only 10% of patients respond to medications": "This misinterprets the statistic. If 90% is placebo, it doesn't mean only 10% of patients respond—it means that in those who respond, up to 90% of their improvement might be attributable to expectation rather than the drug's specific pharmacological action.

            "correct": "This is a textbook token economy. Desired behaviors (hygiene tasks) are followed by tokens (secondary reinforcers), which are exchanged for preferred activities (TV time—a reinforcer). This strengthens hygiene behavior through positive reinforcement (adding something pleasant following behavior). Token economies are effective in institutional settings for increasing adaptive behaviors. The immediate token bridges the delay to the larger reinforcer.",
            "incorrect": {
              "Aversion therapy using negative reinforcement": "Aversion therapy pairs an attractive stimulus with a noxious stimulus to create avoidance (like alcohol + nausea). This scenario adds positive consequences for desired behavior, not noxious stimuli. Also, this is positive reinforcement (adding tokens), not negative reinforcement (removing something unpleasant). Aversion therapy doesn't use tokens for rewards.",
              "Systematic desensitization using relaxation": "Systematic desensitization treats phobias through gradual exposure paired with relaxation techniques. This scenario doesn't involve exposure to feared stimuli or relaxation training. It's about reinforcing desired behaviors (hygiene) with tokens, not reducing anxiety about feared situations.",
              "Free association using uncensored thoughts": "Free association is a psychodynamic technique where patients verbally report thoughts without censorship to reveal unconscious material. This scenario describes operant conditioning with tokens and reinforcement, not psychodynamic exploration. Completely different theoretical approaches."

            "correct": "Both are exposure therapies for phobias, but they differ in intensity. Flooding involves immediate, maximum-intensity exposure to the most feared stimulus until anxiety naturally decreases (extinction). Systematic desensitization uses gradual, hierarchical exposure paired with relaxation techniques, moving from least to most feared situations.",
