            "correct": "This study eliminated doubts about whether Milgram's participants truly believed they were giving shocks. Participants gave REAL (though small) shocks to a puppy and could directly see its distress, yet still obeyed. This strengthens Milgram's findings.",
            "incorrect": {
              "It used lower voltage shocks than Milgram": "While true, the significance is that the shocks were REAL and the distress was visible, not just the voltage level.",

              "It was conducted with children": "The study used adult participants, not children. The 'puppy' was the victim receiving shocks, not the participant."

            "correct": "Both studies demonstrate the power of situations and perceived authority to lead ordinary, non-pathological people to behave in harmful ways they wouldn't normally choose. This challenges the 'bad apple' theory and highlights situational power.",
            "incorrect": {
              "Only evil people commit harmful acts": "This is exactly what these studies disproved—ordinary people committed harmful acts when placed in certain situations with authority pressure.",
              "Personality determines behavior more than situations": "This is the opposite lesson—the studies showed that situations can override personality and personal values.",
              "People always resist authority when it conflicts with morals": "These studies showed that people often DON'T resist authority even when it conflicts with their morals, which is what made the findings so disturbing."
