            "correct": "This example illustrates the limitation of using statistical deviation alone to define abnormality. Giftedness is rare but doesn't cause personal distress, dysfunction, or problems. Abnormality typically requires multiple criteria—distress, dysfunction, maladaptiveness—not just statistical rarity.",
            "incorrect": {
              "Giftedness is socially valued, so it cannot be abnormal": "While social value matters, this isn't the core reason. Even socially devalued rare traits aren't disorders if they don't cause distress or dysfunction. The key is absence of harm/impairment, not social approval.",
              "IQ tests are invalid for measuring abnormality": "This misses the point. The issue isn't test validity but that statistical rarity (what IQ measures) is insufficient for defining abnormality. Abnormality requires more than just rarity.",

            "correct": "The material explicitly notes that classification systems don't always work perfectly—comorbidity (having multiple disorders), dimensional variation (symptoms range from mild to severe), and individual differences make categorical diagnosis challenging. Categories are somewhat artificial.",

However, the person 'still attends work daily and completes tasks'—functioning is maintained with NO marked impairment. Hypomania requires ≥4 days (met: 5 days) with no marked impairment. If functioning were severely compromised or hospitalization needed, it would be mania.",

This person has a SPECIFIC, FIXED delusion (microphones in walls) for 3 years—a psychotic symptom. PPD doesn't involve frank delusions, just suspiciousness.",
