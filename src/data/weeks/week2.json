        "Different theoretical approaches are based on different models of the nature of human beings, from deterministic to emphasizing free will.",
        "The Biopsychological approach emphasizes how brain, nervous system, hormones, and genetics influence behavior, using twin and adoption studies.",
        "The Behaviorist approach stresses environmental influences through classical and operant conditioning, focusing on observable behavior.",
        "The Psychodynamic approach (Freud) emphasizes unconscious forces, infantile sexuality, and early experience.",
        "The Humanistic approach believes in free will and emphasizes positive aspects of human development and self-actualization.",
        "The Cognitive approach views the mind as an information-processing system and focuses on mental processes like memory and thinking.",
        "The Evolutionary approach explains mental and behavioral traits as adaptations shaped by natural selection."

To understand why we feel anxious, learn a new skill, or even fall in love, we must look at the brain, nervous system, genetics, and endocrine system. This approach examines how biology impacts behavior through the study of brain structures, neurotransmitters, hormones, and genetic inheritance."
