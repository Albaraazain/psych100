The pseudopatients reported hearing specific voices with existential content.\",\n        \"They reported experiencing visual hallucinations of threatening figures\": \"The hallucinations were auditory, not visual.

If professionals cannot distinguish between genuine patients and people faking a single symptom, this raises serious questions about whether diagnostic categories represent valid, distinguishable conditions or are influenced by context and expectations. The study revealed that the label 'mental patient' can override objective observation of normal behavior, suggesting diagnostic systems may lack the validity and reliability necessary for accurate classification.\",\n      \"incorrect\": {\n        \"Psychiatric hospitals are understaffed and unable to properly evaluate patients\": \"While staffing may have been a factor, the study's primary finding was about the diagnostic system itself, not resource limitations. Even with adequate staff, the contextual bias of the hospital setting prevented recognition of normal behavior.\",\n        \"Schizophrenia is overdiagnosed but other disorders are accurately identified\": \"The study's implications extend beyond schizophrenia to question the entire psychiatric classification system. It wasn't specifically about one disorder being overdiagnosed.\",\n        \"Patients are always better at detecting mental illness than professional staff\": \"While some actual patients suspected the pseudopatients were journalists or researchers, this wasn't the main conclusion.

Staff expect patients to be mentally ill, so normal behaviors are either overlooked or reinterpreted as symptoms. Actual patients, however, had no professional investment in diagnosis and simply observed behavior without the biasing context. This demonstrates how diagnostic labels and settings can profoundly influence clinical judgment, even among trained professionals—a core critique of psychiatric classification systems.\",\n      \"incorrect\": {\n        \"Mental patients have superior diagnostic abilities compared to trained professionals\": \"This oversimplifies the finding. The issue wasn't about patients having better diagnostic skills, but rather that they weren't subject to the same contextual biases and expectations that influenced staff perception.\",\n        \"Staff members were incompetent and should have easily identified the pseudopatients\": \"This misses the point.

Rosenhan sent NO pseudopatients, yet staff 'detected' 41 frauds among 193 admissions (21%). This reveals that psychiatric diagnosis is vulnerable to expectation bias in both directions—seeing illness in healthy people when expecting patients, and seeing fraud in genuinely ill people when expecting deception. It further undermines confidence in the reliability and validity of psychiatric diagnostic processes.\",\n      \"incorrect\": {\n        \"Rosenhan had actually sent the pseudopatients, proving that staff could detect fraud when alert\": \"This is incorrect.
