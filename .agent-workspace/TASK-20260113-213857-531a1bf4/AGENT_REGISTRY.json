Key topics from slides that need more coverage:\n\n1. ROSENHAN STUDY: \"On being sane in insane places\" - pseudopatients admitted to psychiatric hospitals, staff couldn't distinguish them from real patients, raises questions about validity of psychiatric diagnosis\n\n2. DELUSION TYPES (need more detail):\n- Persecutory: being conspired against, spied on, poisoned\n- Reference: neutral events have special personal meaning  \n- Grandiose: special power, identity, knowledge\n- Control delusions: forces controlling thoughts/actions\n- Thought delusions: insertion, withdrawal, broadcasting\n- Somatic: having physical defect despite negative tests\n- Nihilistic: body parts don't exist, one is dead\n\n3. SCHIZOPHRENIA SPECTRUM DISTINCTIONS:\n- Schizophrenia: \u22656 months\n- Schizophreniform: 1-6 months (same symptoms)\n- Schizoaffective: psychosis + mood episodes (key: psychosis occurs WITHOUT mood)\n- Brief Psychotic: 1 day to <1 month, full recovery\n- Delusional Disorder: circumscribed delusions, normal functioning otherwise\n\n4. PERSONALITY DISORDERS (all 10):\n- Cluster A (Odd): Paranoid, Schizoid, Schizotypal\n- Cluster B (Dramatic): Antisocial, Borderline, Histrionic, Narcissistic\n- Cluster C (Anxious): Avoidant, Dependent, OCPD\n\nQuestion format must match existing structure:\n{\n  \"question\": \"Question text?\",\n  \"difficulty\": \"learning|application|tricky\",\n  \"options\": [\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\"],\n  \"answer\": \"Correct option text exactly\",\n  \"explanation\": {\n    \"correct\": \"Why this is right\",\n    \"incorrect\": {\n      \"Option A\": \"Why wrong\",\n      \"Option B\": \"Why wrong\"\n    }\n  }\n}",
