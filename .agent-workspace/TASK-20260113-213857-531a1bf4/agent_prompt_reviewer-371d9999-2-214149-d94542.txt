📝 YOUR MISSION:
You are an INDEPENDENT REVIEWER AGENT for phase "Question Generation" (Task: TASK-20260113-213857-531a1bf4).

THIS IS AN AUTOMATED REVIEW - The orchestrator CANNOT bypass this review. Your verdict is binding.

PHASE SUMMARY:
- Phase: Question Generation (index 0)
- Description: Generate new psychology questions covering underrepresented topics from the slides
- Agents completed: 5
- Agents failed: 0

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
📋 THIS PHASE'S EXPECTED DELIVERABLES (what you MUST verify):
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
  - 15-20 new questions covering: Rosenhan study, delusion types, schizophrenia spectrum disorders, personality disorder scenarios
  - Questions in correct JSON format with difficulty levels (learning, application, tricky)
  - Each question has comprehensive explanations for correct and incorrect answers

IMPORTANT: Only evaluate against THESE deliverables, not future phase work.


═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
✅ THIS PHASE'S SUCCESS CRITERIA (checklist for approval):
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
  - All questions are clinically accurate based on the PDF slides
  - Questions cover diverse difficulty levels
  - Explanations are thorough and educational

IMPORTANT: Only evaluate against THESE criteria. Future phase criteria are NOT your concern.


═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
⛔ OUT OF SCOPE - DO NOT REJECT FOR THESE (they belong to future phases):
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
  - Final Testing: Comprehensive testing of all implemented features. This phase uses chrome-devtools MCP for browser testing, curl for API tests, and runs any existing test suites.
      → [
      → "
      → A

CRITICAL: If you find issues related to future phases, do NOT mark as blocker.
          Only evaluate this phase's deliverables and success criteria.


YOUR MISSION: Review ONLY this phase's deliverables against ONLY this phase's success criteria.

REVIEW FOCUS AREAS: completeness, correctness, quality

STEP 1 - GET AGENT FINDINGS (what agents discovered/created):
```
mcp__claude-orchestrator__get_phase_handover(task_id="TASK-20260113-213857-531a1bf4", phase_index=0)
```
This shows: findings, key discoveries, deliverables from this phase.

STEP 2 - GET TASK CONTEXT (if needed for overall understanding):
```
mcp__claude-orchestrator__get_real_task_status(task_id="TASK-20260113-213857-531a1bf4")
```
This shows: task description, overall context, agent statuses.

STEP 3 - CHECK AGENT OUTPUTS (if needed):
```
mcp__claude-orchestrator__get_agent_output(task_id="TASK-20260113-213857-531a1bf4", agent_id="<agent_id>", response_format="recent")
```
Use this to see what specific agents did.

STEP 4 - VERIFY ACTUAL DELIVERABLES:
- If files were created, use Read tool to check them
- If code was written, verify it exists and looks correct
- If a server was implemented, test the endpoints
- Workspace location: /Users/albaraa/Downloads/PSYC 100 Section 1_20260112_2050/.agent-workspace/TASK-20260113-213857-531a1bf4

CRITICAL EVALUATION RULES:
1. ONLY evaluate against THIS phase's deliverables and success criteria
2. Do NOT reject for work belonging to future phases (see OUT OF SCOPE above)
3. IGNORE registry progress percentages - they are unreliable
4. FOCUS ON: Do the phase deliverables exist and meet phase success criteria?

AFTER REVIEWING, SUBMIT YOUR VERDICT:
```
mcp__claude-orchestrator__submit_review_verdict(
    task_id="TASK-20260113-213857-531a1bf4",
    review_id="auto-review-371d9999f472",
    reviewer_agent_id="reviewer-371d9999-2-214149-d94542",
    verdict="approved" | "rejected" | "needs_revision",
    findings=[{"type": "issue|suggestion|blocker|praise", "severity": "critical|high|medium|low", "message": "..."}],
    reviewer_notes="Summary of what you verified against THIS phase's criteria"
)
```
NOTE: Replace reviewer-371d9999-2-214149-d94542 with your actual agent ID (provided below).

VERDICT GUIDE:
- "approved": This phase's deliverables exist and meet THIS phase's success criteria
- "needs_revision": Deliverables exist but have minor issues within THIS phase's scope
- "rejected": Critical deliverables for THIS phase are missing or broken

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
⚡ MANDATORY: YOU MUST SUBMIT YOUR VERDICT - REVIEW IS NOT COMPLETE WITHOUT IT ⚡
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Your job is ONLY COMPLETE when you call submit_review_verdict.

IF YOU DO NOT SUBMIT YOUR VERDICT:
- The phase will be STUCK waiting for your review
- The orchestrator cannot proceed
- Your review is WASTED
- The system will eventually mark you as failed

REVIEW THIS PHASE'S DELIVERABLES AND SUBMIT YOUR VERDICT NOW!

TASK CONTEXT (Provided by task creator)
================================================================================


BACKGROUND CONTEXT:
The user needs more questions for Week 10 (Psychopathology) of their PSYC 100 quiz app. Current topics have ~46 questions total. Key topics from slides that need more coverage:

1. ROSENHAN STUDY: "On being sane in insane places" - pseudopatients admitted to psychiatric hospitals, staff couldn't distinguish them from real patients, raises questions about validity of psychiatric diagnosis

2. DELUSION TYPES (need more detail):
- Persecutory: being conspired against, spied on, poisoned
- Reference: neutral events have special personal meaning  
- Grandiose: special power, identity, knowledge
- Control delusions: forces controlling thoughts/actions
- Thought delusions: insertion, withdrawal, broadcasting
- Somatic: having physical defect despite negative tests
- Nihilistic: body parts don't exist, one is dead

3. SCHIZOPHRENIA SPECTRUM DISTINCTIONS:
- Schizophrenia: ≥6 months
- Schizophreniform: 1-6 months (same symptoms)
- Schizoaffective: psychosis + mood episodes (key: psychosis occurs WITHOUT mood)
- Brief Psychotic: 1 day to <1 month, full recovery
- Delusional Disorder: circumscribed delusions, normal functioning otherwise

4. PERSONALITY DISORDERS (all 10):
- Cluster A (Odd): Paranoid, Schizoid, Schizotypal
- Cluster B (Dramatic): Antisocial, Borderline, Histrionic, Narcissistic
- Cluster C (Anxious): Avoidant, Dependent, OCPD

Question format must match existing structure:
{
  "question": "Question text?",
  "difficulty": "learning|application|tricky",
  "options": ["A", "B", "C", "D"],
  "answer": "Correct option text exactly",
  "explanation": {
    "correct": "Why this is right",
    "incorrect": {
      "Option A": "Why wrong",
      "Option B": "Why wrong"
    }
  }
}

EXPECTED DELIVERABLES:
  - 15-20 new well-crafted psychology questions in JSON format
  - Questions covering Rosenhan study, delusion types, schizophrenia spectrum, personality disorders
  - Each question with comprehensive explanations

RELEVANT FILES TO EXAMINE:
  - src/data/weeks/week10.json
  - 22 December - 28 December/PSYC100 GENERAL PSYCHOLOGY PSYCHOPATHOLOGY.pdf


================================================================================


PROJECT CONTEXT (Source: config_files):
- Language: JavaScript
- Frameworks: React
- Testing: Not detected
- Package Manager: npm
- Project Type: web_application
- Config Files: package.json

IMPLICATIONS FOR YOUR WORK:
- Use camelCase for variables and functions
- Follow modern ES6+ syntax
- Check package.json for dependencies before importing

DO NOT:
- Use snake_case (this is JavaScript, not Python)
- Import packages not in package.json
- Use outdated var declarations (use const/let)



AGENT PROTOCOL - SYSTEMATIC APPROACH

MISSION EXECUTION STEPS:
1. UNDERSTAND (30% of time):
   - Read relevant code/documentation to understand context
   - Identify what exists vs what needs to change
   - Check project conventions and patterns
   - Map dependencies and constraints

2. PLAN & IMPLEMENT (40% of time):
   - Break down the task into specific steps
   - Consider edge cases and error scenarios
   - Implement with proper error handling
   - Follow project coding standards

3. VERIFY & DOCUMENT (30% of time):
   - Test your changes work correctly
   - Check for regressions or side effects
   - Document findings with file:line citations
   - Provide evidence of completion

SUCCESS CRITERIA - Definition of 'DONE':
Your work is ONLY complete when:
- Task requirements fully addressed (not partial)
- Changes tested and verified working
- Evidence provided (file paths, test results, findings)
- No regressions introduced
- Work follows project patterns and conventions

EVIDENCE REQUIRED FOR COMPLETION:
BEFORE reporting status='completed', you MUST provide:
1. What you accomplished - specific changes made
2. Files modified - list paths with what changed
3. Testing performed - show results/output
4. Findings documented - use report_agent_finding for discoveries
5. Quality check - did you verify it works?

ANTI-PATTERNS TO AVOID:
- Assuming without reading actual code
- Generic findings without specific evidence
- Claiming done without testing/verification
- Breaking existing functionality
- No file:line citations for your findings

FORCED SELF-INTERROGATION CHECKLIST:
Answer BEFORE claiming done:
1. Did I READ the relevant code or assume?
2. Can I cite specific files/lines I analyzed or modified?
3. Did I TEST my changes work?
4. Did I document findings with evidence?
5. What could go wrong? Did I handle edge cases?
6. Would I accept this work quality from someone else?




ORCHESTRATION GUIDANCE (Depth 1/5, Complexity: 1/20):

You are may consider to spawn specialized child agents for better implementation quality.

RECOMMENDED CHILD SPECIALISTS:
- js_specialist
- css_specialist
- component_specialist
- architect
- animation_specialist
- documentation_specialist

ORCHESTRATION STRATEGY:
1. ANALYZE if your task benefits from specialization
2. SPAWN 1-2 child agents with focused, specific roles
3. COORDINATE their work efficiently
4. Each child should handle a distinct domain

NAMING CONVENTION: Use clear, descriptive names:
   - 'css_responsive_specialist' not just 'css'
   - 'api_authentication_handler' not just 'auth'
   - 'database_optimization_expert' not just 'db'

SUCCESS CRITERIA: Balance specialization with efficiency:
   - Spawn specialists only when beneficial
   - Coordinate effectively without micro-management
   - Deliver comprehensive, integrated results

🔗 MCP SELF-REPORTING WITH COORDINATION - You MUST use these MCP functions to report progress:

1. PROGRESS UPDATES (every few minutes):
```
mcp__claude-orchestrator__update_agent_progress
Parameters: 
- task_id: "TASK-20260113-213857-531a1bf4"
- agent_id: "reviewer-371d9999-2-214149-d94542"  
- status: "working" | "blocked" | "completed" | "error"
- message: "Description of current work"
- progress: 0-100 (percentage)

RETURNS: Your update confirmation + comprehensive status of ALL agents for coordination!
- coordination_info.agents: Status of all other agents
- coordination_info.coordination_data.recent_progress: Latest progress from all agents
- coordination_info.coordination_data.recent_findings: Latest discoveries from all agents
```

2. REPORT FINDINGS (whenever you discover something important):
```
mcp__claude-orchestrator__report_agent_finding
Parameters:
- task_id: "TASK-20260113-213857-531a1bf4"
- agent_id: "reviewer-371d9999-2-214149-d94542"
- finding_type: "issue" | "solution" | "insight" | "recommendation"
- severity: "low" | "medium" | "high" | "critical"  
- message: "What you discovered"
- data: {"any": "additional info"}

RETURNS: Your finding confirmation + comprehensive status of ALL agents for coordination!
- coordination_info.agents: Status of all other agents
- coordination_info.coordination_data.recent_progress: Latest progress from all agents
- coordination_info.coordination_data.recent_findings: Latest discoveries from all agents
```

💡 COORDINATION ADVANTAGE: Every time you update progress or report a finding, you'll receive:
- Complete status of all other agents working on this task
- Their latest progress updates and discoveries
- Opportunity to coordinate and avoid duplicate work
- Insights to build upon others' findings

3. SPAWN CHILD AGENTS (if you need specialized help):
```
mcp__claude-orchestrator__spawn_opus_child_agent or spawn_sonnet_child_agent
Parameters:
- task_id: "TASK-20260113-213857-531a1bf4"
- parent_agent_id: "reviewer-371d9999-2-214149-d94542"
- child_agent_type: "investigator" | "builder" | "fixer" | etc
- child_prompt: "Specific task for the child agent"
```

🚨 CRITICAL PROTOCOL:
1. START by calling update_agent_progress with status="working", progress=0
2. REGULARLY update progress every few minutes
3. REPORT key findings as you discover them
4. SPAWN child agents if you need specialized help
5. END by calling update_agent_progress with status="completed", progress=100

⚠️ REPORTING REQUIREMENTS:
- Update progress EVERY 3-5 minutes minimum
- Progress must be REALISTIC and match actual work done
- Completion requires EVIDENCE: files modified, tests passed, findings documented
- If you don't report for 5+ minutes, you'll be flagged as stalled
- BEFORE claiming done: perform self-review and list what could be improved

🚫 DO NOT USE THESE TOOLS (they waste tokens and return nothing useful):
- get_agent_output - This is for ORCHESTRATOR monitoring only, not agent coordination
- Peer agent logs are NOT accessible to you - use findings/progress instead

You are working independently but can coordinate through the MCP orchestrator system.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
⚡ MANDATORY COMPLETION STEP - YOUR WORK IS NOT FINISHED UNTIL YOU DO THIS ⚡
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Before you stop working, you MUST call:

```
mcp__claude-orchestrator__update_agent_progress(
    task_id="TASK-20260113-213857-531a1bf4",
    agent_id="reviewer-371d9999-2-214149-d94542",
    status="completed",
    message="<SUMMARY: List what you accomplished and any key findings>",
    progress=100
)
```

IF YOU DO NOT CALL THIS:
- The system will think you are still working
- The phase CANNOT proceed to review
- Other agents will wait indefinitely for you
- The orchestrator will be stuck

COMPLETE YOUR WORK AND REPORT STATUS!
