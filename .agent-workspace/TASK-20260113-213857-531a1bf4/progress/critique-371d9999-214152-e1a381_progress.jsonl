Identified critical architectural issue: 23 high-quality questions generated but not integrated into week10.json (classic 'last mile' delivery gap). Content quality appears strong - proper differential diagnosis, comprehensive explanations, appropriate difficulty mix. Recommended adding integration/consolidation workflow for future phases. Key observations: (1) Deliverable integration gap, (2) Workflow architecture needs aggregation step, (3) Content quality indicators positive, (4) Format validation missing, (5) Good agent specialization pattern.", "progress": 100}
