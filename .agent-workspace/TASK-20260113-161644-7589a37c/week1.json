Psychology is the scientific study of the mind, brain, and behaviour, exploring thoughts, emotions, and actions to understand individuals and groups. It's a diverse, interdisciplinary field that uses research and experimentation to gain insights into human development, mental processes, and the factors—biological, social, and environmental—that influence how we think, feel, and behave."
