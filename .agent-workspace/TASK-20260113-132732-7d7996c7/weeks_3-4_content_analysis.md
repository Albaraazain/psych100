### Key Concepts & Definitions

#### 1. Learning Definition
**Definition:** A relatively permanent change in behaviour, knowledge, capability, or attitude that occurs as a result of experience (Ormrod, 2016). Involves acquisition, modification, or strengthening of behaviours through interaction with environment. Excludes changes due to maturation, fatigue, or temporary states.

**Examples:**
- NOT learning: child walking (maturation), slower reactions when tired (fatigue), altered behavior from mood swing (temporary state)

#### 2. Classical Conditioning (Pavlov)
**Core Concepts:**
- **UCS (Unconditioned Stimulus):** Food - naturally produces salivation
- **UCR (Unconditioned Response):** Salivation - automatic, reflex, biologically built-in response
- **CS (Conditioned Stimulus):** Bell - produces salivation only after conditioning
- **CR (Conditioned Response):** Salivation to bell after conditioning

**Key Principles:**
- **Generalization:** Responding to all similar sounds
- **Discrimination:** Responding only to the conditioned sound
- **Extinction:** Response is inhibited if CS not paired with UCS (not totally eliminated)
- **Spontaneous Recovery:** Response reappears after extinction

**Applications:**
- **Little Albert (Watson & Rayner, 1920):** Baby conditioned to fear white rat through classical conditioning
- **Little Peter (Jones, 1924):** Demonstrated phobias could be reversed through gradual exposure and positive associations (unconditioning/desensitization)
- **Peter case details:** 2 years 10 months old, feared furry animals (rat, rabbits, fur coats, feathers, cotton wool). Treatment: seated at table with favorite foods while feared stimulus introduced at safe distance, gradually reduced distance. Result: stopped crying, tolerated proximity, eventually petted rabbit.

**Phobia Treatment:**
- Exposure therapy - systematic desensitization

#### 3. Operant Conditioning

**Edward Thorndike - Puzzle Box Experiments:**
- **Procedure:** Cats placed in puzzle boxes, needed to escape to get food
- **Observations:** Initially random behaviors (scratching, clawing, biting), then association formed between action (pressing lever) and consequence (escape/food), time to escape decreased with repeated trials
- **Law of Effect:** Behaviors followed by satisfying consequences more likely to be repeated; behaviors followed by unsatisfying consequences less likely to occur

**B.F. Skinner - Skinner Box:**
- **Procedure:** Rat in box with lever that dispenses food
- **Observations:**
  - Rat accidentally presses lever, gets food pellet
  - Learns to associate lever-pressing with reward
  - Rate/pattern depends on reinforcement type
  - Continuous reinforcement: rapid learning
  - Intermittent reinforcement: more resistant to extinction
  - Punishment (shock) decreases behavior
- **Key Finding:** Behavior shaped by reinforcement (increases behavior) and punishment (decreases behavior)

**Four Types:**
1. **Positive Reinforcement:** Adding pleasant stimulus (employee gets bonus for meeting sales target)
2. **Negative Reinforcement:** Removing unpleasant stimulus (driver buckles seatbelt to stop warning beep)
3. **Positive Punishment:** Adding unpleasant stimulus (teenager gets extra chores for breaking curfew)
4. **Negative Punishment:** Removing pleasant stimulus (driver loses money from speeding ticket)

**Schedules of Reinforcement:** [Mentioned but not detailed in source]

#### 4. Comparison: Classical vs Operant Conditioning
- Both are associative learning
- **CC:** Involuntary learning; stimulus guaranteed to produce response; UCS works same way for pleasurable/aversive; reinforcer presented regardless of behavior, before response
- **OC:** Voluntary learning; likelihood of response depends on past consequences; pleasurable outcomes repeated, aversive avoided; reinforcer only if specific behavior emitted, after behavior

#### 5. Preparedness (Seligman, 1970)
**Concept:** Animals biologically prepared to learn actions related to species survival with little training. Contraprepared behaviors contrary to natural tendencies, learned with great difficulty.

**Evidence - Animals:**
- Mineka (1980s): Rhesus monkeys quickly learned to fear snakes after observing other monkeys' fearful reactions (video or live). Fear acquired after 1-2 exposures, persisted longer than fears of neutral stimuli (flowers)

**Evidence - Humans:**
- Ohman et al. (1975): Humans easily conditioned to fear spiders/snakes, but not flowers/houses/berries
- Fear of heights: Easily strengthened (Gibson & Walk, 1960)
- Fear of dark: Stronger fear responses to dark environments paired with aversive stimuli, more resistant to extinction (Grillon et al., 1997)
- Evolutionary relevant vs modern stimuli: Snake fears stronger, acquired faster, more resistant to extinction than electrical outlet fears (Öhman & Mineka)

#### 6. Cognitive Approaches

**Social Learning Theory (Bandura, 1977):**
- Focuses on observational learning (modeling)
- Cognitive factors crucial
- Example: Bobo doll experiment

**Tolman's Cognitive Behaviourism - Latent Learning:**
- Maze experiments with rats (1930s)
- **Finding:** Group 3 learned maze layout during non-rewarded trials but didn't demonstrate learning until reward introduced
- **Concept:** Latent learning - learning occurs without immediate reinforcement, expressed later when reinforcer introduced
- **Cognitive Maps:** Mental representations of environment
- **Contrast with Operant:** Challenges strict behaviorist view that immediate reinforcement necessary; learning can occur without immediate consequences

**Kohler's Insight Learning (1925):**
- Chimps demonstrated learning by INSIGHT
- **Definition:** Sudden perception of useful relationship that helps solve problem
- Not trial-and-error, but sudden understanding

#### 7. Learned Helplessness (Seligman, 1960s)
**Definition:** Condition where individual/animal, after repeated exposure to uncontrollable negative events, develops belief they cannot influence outcomes, leading to passivity and reduced motivation, even when control is possible.

**Connections:**
- **Classical Conditioning:** Associating aversive stimulus with lack of control → conditioned response of helplessness
- **Operant Conditioning:** When actions consistently fail to produce desired outcomes, individual learns behavior has no effect → reduces future attempts (negative reinforcement of passivity)
- **Cognitive Learning:** Perception and belief that one is powerless shapes expectations and behavior in new situations

## Week 4: Motivation (October 20-26)
**Source:** PSYC100 GENERAL PSYCHOLOGY MOTIVATION.txt

### Learning Outcomes
1. What is motivation?
2. Motivation theories
3. Drive theory
4. Instinct theory
5. Arousal theory
6. Expectancy-value theory
7. Intrinsic-extrinsic motivation
8. Achievement motivation

### Key Concepts & Definitions

#### 1. Motivation Definition
**Definitions:**
- "Processes involved in the initiation, direction, and energization of individual behaviour" (Geen, 1995)
- "Study of all those pushes and prods – biological, social and psychological – that defeat our laziness and move us, either eagerly or reluctantly, to action" (Miller, 1962)

**Categories (Rubin & McNeil, 1983):**
1. Survival/physiological motives
2. Competence/cognitive motives
3. Social motives

#### 2. Drive Theory (Clark Hull, 1943)
**Core Concept:** Based on body's homeostasis

**Homeostasis:** Natural tendency to keep body in state of equilibrium (liver, kidneys, brain)

**Drive Theory:** Physiological disruptions to homeostasis produce drives (internal tensions that motivate organism to engage in behavior to reduce tension)

**Examples:** Thirst, hunger

**Evaluation:**
- **Drawbacks:**
  - Dieting contrary to drive to eat
  - People often eat when not hungry
- **Reductionist:** Oversimplifies complex behavior

**Questions to consider:**
- What makes you eat?
- Why do you get hungry?
- How much do social factors play a part in eating behavior?

#### 3. Instinct Theory
**Definition:** Instincts are automatic, involuntary, and unlearned patterns of behavior triggered by presence of particular stimuli

**Examples:**
- Babies born with instinct to cry (survival ability)
- Coughing, blinking

**Evolutionary Perspective (Buss, 1999):** Desire to pass on genes provides motivational forces for love, romantic relationships, attraction, marriage

**Evaluation:**
- **Drawbacks:**
  - Ignores learning and environment
  - Doesn't account for individual differences
  - Empirical challenges: Hard to test innate responses, difficult to isolate from learned responses
- **Reductionist**

#### 4. Arousal Theory
**Core Concept:** People take actions to either decrease or increase arousal levels

**Optimal Arousal:** Motivated to maintain optimal level of arousal (varies by individual/situation)

**Examples:**
- Low arousal → watch exciting movie, go for jog
- High arousal → meditate, read book
- Parachute jumping (high arousal seeking)

**Learning Component:** We learn what keeps our own arousal levels at optimum level

**Evaluation:**
- **Drawbacks:**
  - Neglects emotional and social motivators
  - Empirical testing challenges
- **Reductionist**

#### 5. Expectancy-Value Theory
**Formula:** Motivation = Expectancy × Incentive Value

**Definition:** Goal-directed behavior jointly determined by:
1. Strength of person's expectation that behaviors will lead to goal
2. Incentive value individual places on that goal (Brehm & Self, 1989)

**Example:**
- College student preparing for midterm
- High expectancy: Consistently scored high on practice quizzes
- High value: Exam worth 30% of grade, aims for postgraduate program
- Result: Motivated to study hard
- Contrast: Low confidence in math (low expectancy) + no interest in subject (low value) = skip studying

**Evaluation:**
- **Drawbacks:**
  - Based on subjective experiences (student might overestimate skills)
  - External influences (financial constraints affect motivation)
  - Overemphasis on rationality (emotions, procrastination, impulsivity often larger role in college)
  - Cultural and social variability

#### 6. Intrinsic-Extrinsic Motivation
**Extrinsic Motivation:** Performing activity to obtain external reward or avoid punishment

**Intrinsic Motivation:** Performing activity for its own sake - because you find it enjoyable or challenging

**Examples:**
- **Intrinsic:** Student enrolls in creative writing because they love storytelling and find joy in crafting narratives, even if not required for major. Process of writing itself is rewarding.
- **Extrinsic:** Student enrolls in creative writing because it's very easy and will get good grade.

**Evaluation:**
- **Drawbacks:**
  - Over-simplification of motivation
  - Individual differences: Students vary in response to intrinsic vs extrinsic motivators. Personality traits (conscientiousness) or cultural backgrounds (collectivist cultures valuing group recognition) influence which factors more motivating
  - Contextual factors: External pressures like financial stress can overshadow both types. Student might love subject (intrinsic) but lack energy due to part-time work demands

#### 7. Achievement Motivation (McClelland & Atkinson, 1953)
**Concept:** Need for achievement

**Components:**
1. Positively oriented motive for success
2. Negatively oriented motivation to avoid failure (fear of failure)

**Measurement Method - TAT (Thematic Apperception Test):**
- Projective psychological test
- Individuals shown ambiguous pictures
- Asked to create stories about them
- Developed by David McClelland and John Atkinson

**Evaluation:**
- **Drawbacks:**
  - TAT is subjective, relies on trained scorers (introduces variability)
  - Measures unconscious motives (may not align with explicit behaviors or self-reported goals)
  - Cultural differences in storytelling styles affect interpretation
