## Week 1: What is Psychology? Psychology as a Science
**Date Range:** September 29 - October 5, 2025

### Learning Objectives
1. Understand the definition and origins of psychology
2. Trace the historical development of psychology from 1879 to present
3. Identify the relationship between psychology and other disciplines
4. Recognize the main areas of psychology
5. Understand the scientific method in psychology and its challenges

### Key Concepts (20 concepts extracted)

#### 1. Psychology Definition
**What it is:** The scientific study of the mind, brain, and behaviour. Etymology: *psyche* (mind, soul, spirit) + *logos* (knowledge, study).

**Why it matters:** Foundation concept establishing psychology as a scientific discipline, not just philosophy.

#### 2. Wilhelm Wundt (1879) - Father of Experimental Psychology
**What he did:** Founded first experimental psychology laboratory in Leipzig, Germany. Introduced:
- **Introspection** - systematic self-observation ("looking inside")
- **Structuralism** - analyzing structure/components of the mind

**Why it matters:** Marks psychology's separation from philosophy as an independent science.

#### 3. William James - Functionalism
**What he did:** Shifted focus from structure ("what is the mind?") to function ("what does the mind do?"). Emphasized individual differences.

**Why it matters:** Influenced educational and industrial psychology by focusing on practical applications.

#### 4. John Watson - Behaviourism
**What he did:** Rejected introspection as too subjective. Emphasized observable behavior only. Famous **Little Albert experiment** (1913-1920) demonstrated classical conditioning in humans (infant conditioned to fear white rat).

**Why it matters:** Made psychology more objective, measurable, and scientific.

#### 5. Cognitive Revolution (1960s)
**What it was:** Shift to studying mental processes using computer models. Key figures: McCarthy (coined "artificial intelligence"), Chomsky, George Miller.

**Why it matters:** Brought the mind back into psychology after behaviorism's dominance over observable behavior.

#### 6. Scientific Method in Psychology
**Six features:**
1. **Empirical evidence** - observable, measurable data
2. **Hypothesis testing** - analyze results, draw conclusions
3. **Testable theories** - e.g., cognitive dissonance, attachment theory
4. **Experimentation** - cause-effect relationships
5. **Quantitative/qualitative methods**
6. **Falsifiability** - theories can be tested and potentially disproven

**Why it matters:** Establishes psychology as legitimate science alongside biology and physics.

#### 7. Classical Conditioning (Pavlov, 1904)
**What it is:** Learning through association. Pavlov's dogs salivated to bell that predicted food.

**Why it matters:** Foundation of behaviorist approach to learning, explains automatic emotional responses.

#### 8. Operant Conditioning (Skinner, 1935)
**What it is:** Learning through consequences:
- **Positive Reinforcement** - add reward
- **Negative Reinforcement** - remove aversive stimulus
- **Positive Punishment** - add aversive stimulus
- **Negative Punishment** - remove reward

**Why it matters:** Explains voluntary behavior modification, used in education and therapy.

#### 9. Challenges in Psychological Research

**A. Experimenter Bias**
- Researcher's expectations influence results
- Solution: Double-blind procedures

**B. Demand Characteristics**
- Cues reveal experiment's purpose, participants change behavior
- Solution: Deception studies (ethical concerns)

**C. Internal vs External Validity Trade-off**
- **Internal validity** - observed effects are due to IV manipulation (laboratory control)
- **External validity** - results generalizable to real-world settings
- Challenge: High lab control ≠ real-world applicability

**D. Representativeness Problem**
- Most studies use WEIRD samples (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, Democratic)
- Cultural factors affect generalizability

**E. Social Nature of Science**
- Psychologists are part of their subject matter
- Objectivity harder than in physics or chemistry

## Week 2: Theoretical Approaches to Psychology
**Date Range:** October 6 - October 12, 2025

### Learning Objectives
1. Understand the biopsychological approach and behavior genetics methods
2. Explain behaviorist principles (classical and operant conditioning)
3. Describe psychodynamic theory (Freud's personality structure and psychosexual stages)
4. Identify humanistic psychology's key concepts (self-actualization, unconditional positive regard)
5. Understand cognitive psychology's information-processing approach
6. Explain evolutionary psychology's principles and applications

### The Six Major Theoretical Approaches

---

## I. THE BIOPSYCHOLOGICAL APPROACH

### Core Idea
Psychological phenomena are rooted in **biological processes** - brain, nervous system, genetics, hormones.

### Key Concepts

**1. Nature vs Nurture**
- **Nature** - genetics, biology
- **Nurture** - environment, upbringing, culture

**2. Behavior Genetics**
Studies three sources of trait variation:
1. **Genetic differences** (heritability)
2. **Shared environments** (family, culture)
3. **Non-shared environments** (unique experiences)

Examples: intelligence, personality, addiction

**3. Twin Studies**
- Compare **Monozygotic (MZ)** twins (100% DNA shared) vs **Dizygotic (DZ)** twins (50% DNA shared)
- **Concordance rate** - similarity measure between twins
- If MZ twins more similar than DZ twins → genetics plays stronger role
- **Equal Environments Assumption** - both twin types experience similar environments

**Methods:**
- Classical Twin Design - twins raised together
- Twins Reared Apart - separated at birth (isolates genetic effects)

**4. Adoption Studies**
- Compare adopted children to biological parents (genetic) vs adoptive parents (environmental)
- If child resembles biological parents → genetics
- If child resembles adoptive parents → environment

### Biological Examples
- **Schizophrenia** - excess dopamine
- **Depression** - low serotonin
- **Addiction** - dopamine reward pathways
- **Extroversion** - low arousal levels (need stimulation)
- **Aggression** - testosterone levels

### Criticisms
❌ **Reductionism** - oversimplifies complex behaviors to biology
❌ **Ethical concerns** - animal testing, genetic editing
❌ **Determinism** - ignores neuroplasticity and environmental change

---

## II. THE BEHAVIOURIST APPROACH

### Core Idea
All behaviors are **learned through interactions with environment**. Focus on **observable behavior only** - ignore internal mental states.

### 7 Key Assumptions
1. **Behavior is Learned** - acquired through conditioning
2. **Observable Behavior Only** - thoughts/emotions irrelevant
3. **Environmental Determinism** - behavior determined by external stimuli, not free will
4. **Conditioning Drives Learning** - classical or operant
5. **Tabula Rasa (Blank Slate)** - humans start blank, shaped by experience
6. **Generalization Across Species** - animal studies inform human behavior
7. **Predictability and Control** - behavior can be manipulated via environmental control

### Classical Conditioning (Pavlov)

**Process:**
- **UCS (Unconditioned Stimulus)** → **UCR (Unconditioned Response)**
- Pair Neutral Stimulus with UCS repeatedly
- **CS (Conditioned Stimulus)** → **CR (Conditioned Response)**

**Example:** Pavlov's dogs
- UCS: Food → UCR: Salivation
- Pair bell with food repeatedly
- CS: Bell → CR: Salivation

**Human Application:** Little Albert (Watson)
- UCS: Loud noise → UCR: Fear
- Pair white rat with loud noise
- CS: White rat → CR: Fear

### Operant Conditioning (Skinner)

**Four Consequences:**

| Type | Action | Effect | Example |
|------|--------|--------|---------|
| **Positive Reinforcement** | Add reward | Increase behavior | Give treat for good grade |
| **Negative Reinforcement** | Remove aversive | Increase behavior | Remove chores for good grade |
| **Positive Punishment** | Add aversive | Decrease behavior | Scold for bad grade |
| **Negative Punishment** | Remove reward | Decrease behavior | Remove phone for bad grade |

**Skinner Box:** Controlled chamber where rats/pigeons learned through reinforcement schedules.

### Criticisms
❌ **Overemphasis on Observable Behavior** - ignores thoughts, emotions, consciousness
❌ **Neglect of Innate Factors** - ignores biological predispositions
❌ **Overreliance on Animal Studies** - generalization issues to humans
❌ **Deterministic View** - denies free will
❌ **Ethical Concerns** - Little Albert couldn't consent, never deconditioned
❌ **Individual Differences** - doesn't explain why same environment produces different people

---

## III. THE PSYCHODYNAMIC APPROACH

### Core Idea
Behavior driven by **unconscious forces from within**. Early childhood experiences shape adult personality.

### Sigmund Freud's Key Concepts

**1. Levels of the Mind**
- **Conscious** - currently aware
- **Pre-conscious** - retrievable memories
- **Unconscious** - hidden drives, repressed memories, unacceptable desires

**2. Personality Structure**

| Component | Principle | Function | Develops |
|-----------|-----------|----------|----------|
| **Id** | Pleasure | Immediate gratification, instincts | Birth |
| **Ego** | Reality | Mediates id and superego | 2-3 years |
| **Superego** | Morality | Conscience, social rules | 5-6 years |

**Example:** You see cake when on diet
- **Id:** "Eat it NOW! I want it!"
- **Superego:** "No! You promised to diet!"
- **Ego:** "I'll have a small piece after dinner."

**3. Psychosexual Stages of Development**

| Stage | Age | Focus | Fixation Results |
|-------|-----|-------|------------------|
| **Oral** | 0-1 | Mouth (sucking, biting) | Smoking, overeating, dependency |
| **Anal** | 1-3 | Toilet training | Obsessive cleanliness OR messiness |
| **Phallic** | 3-6 | Genitals, Oedipus complex | Sexual difficulties, authority issues |
| **Latency** | 6-puberty | Dormant sexuality | N/A |
| **Genital** | Puberty+ | Mature sexual relationships | N/A |

**4. Defense Mechanisms**
Unconscious strategies ego uses to manage anxiety:
- **Repression** - push threatening thoughts to unconscious
- **Denial** - refuse to accept reality
- **Projection** - attribute own unacceptable feelings to others
- **Sublimation** - channel unacceptable impulses into socially acceptable activities
- **Rationalization** - create logical explanations for irrational behavior
- **Displacement** - redirect emotions to safer target

**Other Psychodynamic Theorists:**
- **Carl Jung** - analytical psychology, collective unconscious
- **Alfred Adler** - individual psychology, inferiority complex
- **Erik Erikson** - psychosocial development stages (8 stages across lifespan)

### Criticisms
❌ **Lack of Empirical Evidence** - unfalsifiable concepts (can't disprove unconscious)
❌ **Overemphasis on Sexuality** - not everything about sex
❌ **Gender Bias** - penis envy, Oedipus complex
❌ **Neglect of Social/Cultural Influences** - too focused on individual psyche

---

## IV. THE HUMANISTIC APPROACH

### Core Idea
Humans have **free will** and innate drive toward **personal growth and self-actualization**. Rejects determinism of psychoanalysis (unconscious forces) and behaviorism (environmental forces).

### Abraham Maslow - Hierarchy of Needs

**Pyramid Structure (bottom to top):**
1. **Physiological** - food, water, sleep, shelter
2. **Safety** - security, stability, protection
3. **Belongingness** - love, friendship, intimacy
4. **Esteem** - achievement, recognition, respect
5. **Self-Actualization** - realizing full potential, creativity, meaning

**Key Idea:** Must satisfy lower needs before higher needs become motivating.

**Self-Actualization Characteristics:**
- Accept self and others
- Spontaneous and creative
- Problem-centered (not self-centered)
- Peak experiences (moments of intense joy/understanding)

### Carl Rogers - Person-Centered Therapy

**1. Self-Concept**
Individual's perception of self. Healthy development requires **congruence** between:
- **Perceived self** - how you see yourself
- **Actual self** - who you really are

**2. Unconditional Positive Regard**
Acceptance and support regardless of what person says or does. Contrasts with **conditions of worth** (love contingent on meeting standards).

**Example:**
- **Conditional:** "I'll love you IF you get good grades"
- **Unconditional:** "I love you no matter what, even if you fail"

**3. Fully Functioning Person**
Ideal outcome - person experiences congruence, lives authentically, open to experience.

**Three Essential Therapist Attributes:**
1. **Genuineness** (congruence) - authentic, not playing role
2. **Unconditional positive regard** - accept client completely
3. **Empathic understanding** - see world through client's eyes

### Comparison: Maslow vs Rogers

**Similarities:**
- Both emphasize self-actualization as central human drive
- Positive view of humanity (reject pathology focus)
- Holistic approach to whole person

**Differences:**
- **Maslow:** Structured hierarchy of needs (rigid sequence)
- **Rogers:** Fluid actualizing tendency (no rigid stages)

### Criticisms
❌ **Difficult to Test Empirically** - subjective concepts hard to measure
❌ **Overly Optimistic** - ignores capacity for evil, aggression
❌ **Overemphasis on Subjective Experience** - cultural bias (Western individualism)

---

## V. THE COGNITIVE APPROACH

### Core Idea
Focus on **mental processes** - perception, memory, thinking, problem-solving, decision-making. Views mind as **information-processing system** like a computer.

### Key Metaphor: Mind as Computer
- **Input** - sensory information (perception)
- **Processing** - thinking, reasoning, problem-solving
- **Storage** - memory encoding and retrieval
- **Output** - behavior, decisions

### Historical Context
**No single founder** (unlike Watson for behaviorism, Freud for psychodynamic, Rogers for humanistic). Emerged from cognitive revolution in 1960s.

### Key Concepts

**1. Cognitive Maps (Edward Tolman)**
Internal mental representations of spatial environments. Demonstrated rats learn maze **layout** (cognitive map), not just sequence of turns (behaviorist view).

**Why it matters:** Early evidence that learning involves mental representations, not just stimulus-response connections.

**2. Information Processing**
- Encode information (perception)
- Store information (memory)
- Retrieve information (recall)
- Manipulate information (thinking)

### Key Theories (to be covered in detail later)
- **Memory Models** - Atkinson-Shiffrin (multi-store model), Baddeley (working memory)
- **Cognitive Development** - Piaget's stages
- **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)** - Aaron Beck
- **Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy (REBT)** - Albert Ellis

### Modern Applications
- **Artificial Intelligence** - computer models of cognition
- **Education** - understanding how students learn
- **Therapy** - CBT, REBT for depression/anxiety

### Criticisms
❌ **Overemphasis on Mental Processes** - neglects emotions, motivation
❌ **Computer Metaphor Oversimplifies** - ignores creativity, intuition, consciousness
❌ **Reductionist** - breaks cognition into separate processes, loses holistic view

---

## VI. THE EVOLUTIONARY APPROACH

### Core Idea
Human mental and behavioral traits are **adaptations** shaped by **natural selection** to address survival and reproductive challenges in ancestral environments.

### Key Principles

**1. Adaptive Problems**
Challenges in ancestral environments that shaped our minds:
- Finding food
- Selecting mates
- Avoiding predators
- Forming alliances
- Raising offspring

**2. Cognitive Modules**
Mind consists of specialized mechanisms (modules) designed to solve specific adaptive problems. Assumed to be:
- **Universal** - shared by all humans
- **Fixed** - not flexible
- **Domain-specific** - specialized for particular problems

**3. Environment of Evolutionary Adaptedness (EEA)**
Ancestral environment (Pleistocene era, ~2 million - 10,000 years ago) where adaptations evolved. Modern environment dramatically different.

**Example:** We crave sugar/fat because scarce in EEA, but now leads to obesity.

### Applications to Human Behavior

**1. Mate Preferences and Sexual Selection (Buss, 1989)**

**Men's Preferences:**
- Physical attractiveness (indicates youth, fertility)
- Waist-hip ratio 0.7 (indicates health)

**Women's Preferences:**
- Resources (ability to provide)
- Status, ambition
- Older age (accumulated resources)

**Why:** Divergent reproductive roles
- Men: unlimited sperm, maximize partners
- Women: limited eggs, 9-month pregnancy, choose quality

**2. Jealousy as Mate-Retention Strategy (Buss et al., 1992)**

**Men more distressed by:**
- **Sexual infidelity** (paternity uncertainty - "Mommy's baby, Daddy's maybe")

**Women more distressed by:**
- **Emotional infidelity** (resource loss - partner might leave)

**3. Fear of Snakes and Spiders (Öhman & Mineka, 2001)**

**Preparedness Theory:**
- Innate fears evolved to protect from ancestral threats
- Easier to condition fear of snakes/spiders than flowers/mushrooms
- Even though cars/guns more dangerous today

**4. Parental Investment and Attachment (Bowlby, 1969)**

**Mothers:**
- Higher reproductive costs (pregnancy, nursing)
- More nurturing, immediate bonding
- Oxytocin release during childbirth/breastfeeding

**Fathers:**
- Lower certainty of paternity
- Conditional investment based on paternity confidence
- Focus on resource provision

### Criticisms
❌ **Falsifiability Issues** - hard to test claims about ancestral environments
❌ **Reductionism** - reduces complex behaviors to simple adaptations
❌ **Misinterpretation Risk** - may be misused to justify inequalities ("natural" doesn't mean "right")
