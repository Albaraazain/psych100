### KEY CONCEPTS - MEMORY

#### 1. **What is Memory?**
- **Definition**: Three interrelated processes for managing information
- **Registration/Encoding**: Transformation of sensory input into storable format
- **Storage**: Retaining information over time
- **Retrieval**: Extracting stored information when needed

**Types of Encoding:**
- **Acoustic encoding**: encoding of sound (e.g., repeating phone number aloud)
- **Visual encoding**: encoding of images (e.g., picturing a face)
- **Semantic encoding**: encoding of meaning (e.g., understanding "justice" means fairness)

---

#### 2. **Three Forms of Storage**

**A. Sensory Memory**
- Initial stage where sensory information briefly held
- Duration: less than 1 second to a few seconds
- Acts as buffer for processing

**B. Short-Term Memory (STM)**
- **Capacity**: 7±2 items (Miller, 1956) - "magic number"
- **Duration**: 15-30 seconds without rehearsal (Peterson & Peterson, 1959)
- **Coding**: Mainly acoustic, some semantic, visual possible
- **Chunking**: Grouping information increases capacity (e.g., hyphenated phone numbers)
- Information lost if not rehearsed within 18-30 seconds

**C. Long-Term Memory (LTM)**
- **Capacity**: Potentially unlimited
- **Duration**: Minutes to entire lifetime
- **Coding**: Largely semantic, but also visual and acoustic
- Examples: knowing "whale is mammal" (semantic), childhood home appearance (visual), favorite song tune (acoustic)

---

#### 3. **The Multi-Store Model (MSM)**
**Developers**: Atkinson & Shiffrin (1968)

**Structure**:
- Sensory Register → Short-Term Memory → Long-Term Memory
- Information flows through rehearsal from STM to LTM

**Supporting Evidence**:
1. **Serial Position Effect (Murdock, 1962)**
   - Primacy effect: good recall of beginning items (LTM)
   - Recency effect: best recall of end items (STM)
   - Poor recall of middle items

2. **Coding Studies (Miller & Selfridge, 1950)**
   - Acoustic coding in STM
   - Semantic coding in LTM
   - Some overlap showing semantic structure aids STM recall

3. **Brain-Damaged Patients: HM Case**
   - Anterograde amnesia after brain surgery
   - STM intact, old LTM intact, NEW LTM severely impaired
   - Strong evidence for separate memory systems

---

#### 4. **Types of Long-Term Memory**

**A. Episodic Memory (Explicit/Declarative)**
- Storage of personally experienced events with time/place context
- Includes "what," "when," "where," and emotions
- **Examples**:
  - Autobiographical: First day of university, how lecturer looked
  - Flashbulb memories: Death of celebrity (Michael Jackson, Princess Diana)

**B. Semantic Memory (Explicit/Declarative)**
- General knowledge, facts, concepts
- NOT tied to personal experience or specific context
- **Examples**:
  - Knowing 2+2=4
  - Knowing "cat" refers to furry animal

**C. Procedural Memory (Implicit/Non-Declarative)**
- Unconscious recall of skills and habits
- Learned through practice
- Expressed through performance, not conscious recollection
- **Examples**:
  - Riding bicycle
  - Chess pattern recognition
  - Brushing teeth routine

---

#### 5. **The Working Memory Model (WMM)**
**Developers**: Baddeley & Hitch (1974; 2000)

**Key Insight**: STM is ACTIVE system that manipulates/processes info, not just passive storage

**Components**:
1. **Central Executive**: Manager; directs attention; coordinates subsystems; limited capacity
2. **Phonological Loop**: Stores spoken words briefly; allows rehearsal
3. **Visuo-Spatial Sketchpad**: Holds and manipulates visual images
4. **Episodic Buffer**: Integrates info from different sources (sound, vision, LTM) into single episode

**MSM vs WMM Comparison**:
- **MSM**: STM is single, passive store; focus on structure (where info goes); simple, linear
- **WMM**: STM is active with multiple components; focus on process (how info handled); detailed, dynamic

**Example - Shopping List**:
- **MSM approach**: Hear list → sensory memory → rehearse in STM → transfer to LTM
- **WMM approach**: Phonological loop repeats items; central executive maintains focus; episodic buffer links "milk" with image of empty fridge

---

#### 6. **The Levels of Processing Model (LOP)**
**Developers**: Craik & Lockhart (1972)

**Key Challenge to MSM**:
- Jenkins (1974): Incidental learning occurs (remembering WITHOUT rehearsing)
- What matters is TYPE of rehearsal/processing, not just repetition
- Deep, semantic processing achieves LTM without simple rehearsal

**Key Evidence - Craik & Tulving (1975)**:
Participants answered different questions about words:
- **Shallow (structural)**: "Is word in capital letters?" → Poor recall
- **Intermediate (phonemic)**: "Does word rhyme with 'cat'?" → Moderate recall
- **Deep (semantic)**: "Does word fit: 'The ___ walked into room'?" → Best recall

**Result**: Words processed semantically remembered MUCH better
**Conclusion**: Depth of processing, not rehearsal, determines memory strength
**Impact**: Strong evidence AGAINST MSM's rehearsal requirement

**Example - Word "elephant"**:
- **MSM**: Repeat "elephant" until transfers to LTM
- **LOP**: Think about elephant's appearance, size, connect with zoo → more memorable

---

#### 7. **Theories of Forgetting**

Forgetting can occur at encoding, storage, or retrieval stages.

**A. Decay Theory (STM + LTM)**
- Memories fade over time without access/rehearsal
- Natural deterioration of memory traces

**B. Displacement Theory (STM)**
- New information pushes out old information
- Exceeds limited STM capacity
- Relevant to STM's 7±2 capacity limit

**C. Interference Theory (LTM)**
- New or old information disrupts recall of other memories

**Two Types**:
1. **Proactive Interference**: OLD interferes with NEW
   - Examples: Old phone number pops up when recalling new one; old password blocks new password recall

2. **Retroactive Interference**: NEW interferes with OLD
   - Examples: New language vocabulary makes old language harder; new dance steps cause forgetting of old ones

**Efficient Forgetting Concept**:
- Schacter (2002): Efficient forgetting is CRUCIAL for functioning memory
- People with hyperthymestic syndrome (HSAM) lack this ability
- Superior autobiographical memory can be problematic

2. Identify Gestalt principles of perceptual organization
3. Explain depth perception using pictorial and non-pictorial cues
4. Understand perceptual constancy principles
5. Analyze visual illusions
6. Compare ecological and constructivist theories of visual perception

---

### KEY CONCEPTS - PERCEPTION

#### 1. **What is Perception?**
- **Definition**: Organization and interpretation of sensory information to form inner representations of external world
- **Key Insight**: We don't perceive 'reality' but how our brain interprets it (Macknik & Martinez-Conde, 2014)
- **Ehrenfels (1890)**: Groups of stimuli acquire pattern quality GREATER than sum of parts
  - Example: Melody - individual notes vs. recognizable tune

**Important Terminology**:
- **Distal stimulus**: The actual object you're looking at
- **Proximal stimulus**: Pattern of stimulation hitting the retina
- **Perceptual Challenge**: Distal stimulus constant, but proximal stimulus varies → how does perception remain constant?

---

#### 2. **Gestalt Principles of Perceptual Organization**

**Core Concept**: Brain organizes sensory information into meaningful wholes

**6 Key Principles**:

**1. Figure-Ground Separation**
- First perceptual task: recognize figure as distinct from background
- Must perceive figure separately from surroundings (ground)

**2. Proximity (Law of Perception)**
- Elements close together perceived as group
- Example: Dots placed near each other seen as clusters

**3. Closure (Law of Perception)**
- Tend to complete incomplete forms and fill gaps
- Example: Perceive complete circle/rectangle rather than segments

**4. Similarity (Law of Perception)**
- Similar parts perceived as belonging together
- Dissimilar parts perceived separately
- Example: Array of colored dots seen as alternating rows by color

**5. Continuity (Law of Perception)**
- Group stimuli into forms following continuous lines/patterns
- Example: Two overlapping lines rather than four lines meeting at center

**6. Symmetry (Law of Perception)**
- Symmetrical elements perceived as unified group
- Example: Two overlapping diamonds instead of touching corner bricks

---

#### 3. **Depth Perception**

**Definition**: Ability to see things 3-dimensionally and judge distance

**Two Categories of Depth Cues**:

### A. Non-Pictorial Cues (Physical functioning of eyes/brain)

**1. Retinal Disparity (Binocular)**
- Slight difference in images on each retina due to eye separation
- Brain uses disparity to estimate depth
- Most effective for objects within few meters

**2. Convergence (Binocular)**
- Inward rotation of eyes to focus on nearby object
- Degree of convergence indicates distance
- Angle of eye movement provides distance information

### B. Pictorial Cues (Visual field features - all monocular)

**1. Relative Size**
- Farther objects appear smaller than similar closer objects

**2. Interposition (Occlusion)**
- Object partially blocking another perceived as closer
- Blocked object perceived as farther

**3. Linear Perspective**
- Parallel lines (railroad tracks) converge with distance
- Signals depth

**4. Texture Gradient**
- Textures appear denser and less detailed with distance

**5. Light and Shadow**
- Shadows indicate object shape and 3D position

**6. Aerial Perspective**
- Distant objects hazier/less vivid due to atmospheric scattering
- Suggests greater distance

**7. Relative Height**
- Objects higher in visual field (near horizon) perceived as farther
- Especially relevant in landscapes

**Note**: Predator vs Prey eye placement
- Predators: Forward-facing eyes for depth perception
- Prey: Side-facing eyes for wide field of view

---

#### 4. **Perceptual Constancy**

**Definition**: Ability to perceive object as unchanging despite changes in sensory information reaching eyes

**Five Types**:

**1. Size Constancy**
- Brain perceives object's size as constant despite retinal image changes with distance
- Example: Person appears same size at 5 or 50 feet away
- **Ames Room (1946)**: Illusion where trapezoidal room tricks brain about size relationships

**2. Shape Constancy**
- Object's shape perceived as consistent from different angles
- Example: Door appears rectangular whether viewed head-on or at angle (trapezoid on retina)

**3. Brightness Constancy**
- Objects perceived as having consistent brightness under different illumination
- Example: White shirt appears equally white in sunlight or dim shade

**4. Colour Constancy**
- Object's color perceived as stable under different lighting
- Example: Red apple looks red in sunlight or fluorescent light despite wavelength changes

**5. Location Constancy**
- Moving head produces changing retinal images
- Don't perceive world as spinning
- Due to kinaesthetic feedback

---

#### 5. **Visual Illusions**

**Purpose**: Show how perception can be wrong; what we see isn't truthful reflection of reality
**Key Insight**: Perception based on stimulus PLUS knowledge and experience

**Major Illusions**:

**1. Ponzo Illusion**
- Top horizontal bar appears longer than bottom
- Both actually same length
- Context of converging lines affects perception

**2. Horizontal-Vertical Illusion**
- Vertical line appears longer than horizontal
- Both equal length

**3. Muller-Lyer Illusion**
- Line with outgoing fins appears longer than line with ingoing fins
- Actually same length
- Classic depth perception misapplication

**4. Poggendorf Illusion**
- Diagonal line segments appear offset
- Actually aligned

**5. Titchener's Circles**
- Central circle surrounded by large circles appears smaller
- Central circle surrounded by small circles appears larger
- Both central circles same size
- Context affects size perception

---

#### 6. **Theories of Visual Perception**

### A. Gestalt Theory
- "The whole is greater than the sum of its parts"
- Brain organizes sensory information into meaningful wholes
- Covered in principles section above

### B. Constructivist Theory (Gregory, 1966) - TOP-DOWN

**Core Ideas**:
- Perception is ACTIVE, constructive process
- Brain uses: sensory input + prior knowledge + expectations
- Driven by higher-level cognitive processes (memory, experience, context)
- **Indirect perception**: Brain constructs interpretations

**Key Characteristics**:
- Top-down processing
- Environment provides INCOMPLETE/AMBIGUOUS sensory input
- Cognition is ESSENTIAL
- Uses past experiences, expectations, inferences

**Example**: Reading messy handwriting
- Brain uses context and word knowledge to decipher unclear letters

**Illusion Explanation**: Result from misapplied hypotheses or perceptual errors based on prior knowledge

### C. Ecological Theory (Gibson, 1966) - BOTTOM-UP

**Core Ideas**:
- Perception is DIRECT, doesn't require complex cognitive processing
- Environment provides ALL needed information through "affordances"
- Emphasizes organism-environment interaction
- Focuses on real-world, ecological contexts

**Key Characteristics**:
- Bottom-up processing
- Optic array provides RICH, UNAMBIGUOUS information
- Cognition is MINIMAL
- Direct resonance with environment

**Example**: Walking through forest
- Perceive ground texture and slopes directly
- Navigate without consciously analyzing each step

**Illusion Explanation**: Occur due to insufficient/artificial environmental information (e.g., lab settings), not cognitive errors

### GREGORY vs GIBSON COMPARISON TABLE

| Aspect | Gibson (Ecological/Direct) | Gregory (Constructivist/Indirect) |
|--------|---------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Processing** | Bottom-up, direct | Top-down, indirect |
| **Environment Role** | Central; provides rich, unambiguous info | Provides incomplete/ambiguous input |
| **Cognition Role** | Minimal; direct resonance | Essential; active interpretation |
| **Key Mechanism** | Affordances; optic array | Hypotheses; prior knowledge |
| **Illusions** | Artificial/insufficient info | Misapplied hypotheses |

---

### COMPLEMENTARY VIEW (Harris, 1998)

**Integration Perspective**:
- Perception contributes in MANY different ways to everyday life
- Some tasks more difficult than others
- **Some accomplished directly** (as Gibson maintained)
- **Others require sophisticated internal knowledge** (indirect approach)
- NOT contradictory but complementary

**Implication**: Both theories valid for different perceptual tasks and contexts
