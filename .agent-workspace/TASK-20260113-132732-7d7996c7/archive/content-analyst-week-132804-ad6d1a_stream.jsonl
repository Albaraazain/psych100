His reactions included crying, fleeing, and physiological signs of distress (e.g.,\n    66→sweating, rapid heartbeat).\n    67→Peter was seated at a table with his favorite foods (e.g., candy, crackers, milk) to create a\n    68→positive emotional state. The feared stimulus (starting with the rat, then shifting focus to the\n    69→rabbit as it elicited stronger fear) was introduced at a safe distance (e.g., across the room).\n    70→Over sessions, the distance was gradually reduced while maintaining the pleasant activity,\n    71→associating the stimulus with enjoyment rather than fear.\n    72→Peter's terror subsided progressively.

For instance: Continuous\n   116→reinforcement (reward every time the lever was pressed) led\n   117→to rapid learning. Intermittent reinforcement (reward\n   118→delivered only occasionally, e.g., every third press or at\n   119→random intervals) made the behaviour more resistant to\n   120→extinction (stopping when rewards ceased); If a punishment\n   121→(e.g., a mild shock) was delivered after lever-pressing, the\n   122→behaviour decreased.\n   123→• Key Finding: Skinner’s experiments demonstrated that\n   124→behaviour is shaped by reinforcement (consequences that\n   125→increase behaviour) and punishment (consequences that\n   126→decrease behaviour).\n   127→\n   128→\f\fSome examples\n   129→\n   130→• Positive reinforcement\n   131→- An employee meets a\n   132→sales target and\n   133→receives a bonus.

What is learning?\n2. Behaviourist approaches\n3. Classical conditioning\n4. Operant conditioning\n5. Cognitive approaches\n6. Tolman's cognitive behaviourism\n7. Kohler's insight learning\n\n### Key Concepts & Definitions\n\n#### 1. Learning Definition\n**Definition:** A relatively permanent change in behaviour, knowledge, capability, or attitude that occurs as a result of experience (Ormrod, 2016). Involves acquisition, modification, or strengthening of behaviours through interaction with environment. Excludes changes due to maturation, fatigue, or temporary states.\n\n**Examples:**\n- NOT learning: child walking (maturation), slower reactions when tired (fatigue), altered behavior from mood swing (temporary state)\n\n#### 2. Classical Conditioning (Pavlov)\n**Core Concepts:**\n- **UCS (Unconditioned Stimulus):** Food - naturally produces salivation\n- **UCR (Unconditioned Response):** Salivation - automatic, reflex, biologically built-in response\n- **CS (Conditioned Stimulus):** Bell - produces salivation only after conditioning\n- **CR (Conditioned Response):** Salivation to bell after conditioning\n\n**Key Principles:**\n- **Generalization:** Responding to all similar sounds\n- **Discrimination:** Responding only to the conditioned sound\n- **Extinction:** Response is inhibited if CS not paired with UCS (not totally eliminated)\n- **Spontaneous Recovery:** Response reappears after extinction\n\n**Applications:**\n- **Little Albert (Watson & Rayner, 1920):** Baby conditioned to fear white rat through classical conditioning\n- **Little Peter (Jones, 1924):** Demonstrated phobias could be reversed through gradual exposure and positive associations (unconditioning/desensitization)\n- **Peter case details:** 2 years 10 months old, feared furry animals (rat, rabbits, fur coats, feathers, cotton wool). Treatment: seated at table with favorite foods while feared stimulus introduced at safe distance, gradually reduced distance. Result: stopped crying, tolerated proximity, eventually petted rabbit.\n\n**Phobia Treatment:**\n- Exposure therapy - systematic desensitization\n\n#### 3. Operant Conditioning\n\n**Edward Thorndike - Puzzle Box Experiments:**\n- **Procedure:** Cats placed in puzzle boxes, needed to escape to get food\n- **Observations:** Initially random behaviors (scratching, clawing, biting), then association formed between action (pressing lever) and consequence (escape/food), time to escape decreased with repeated trials\n- **Law of Effect:** Behaviors followed by satisfying consequences more likely to be repeated; behaviors followed by unsatisfying consequences less likely to occur\n\n**B.F. Skinner - Skinner Box:**\n- **Procedure:** Rat in box with lever that dispenses food\n- **Observations:**\n  - Rat accidentally presses lever, gets food pellet\n  - Learns to associate lever-pressing with reward\n  - Rate/pattern depends on reinforcement type\n  - Continuous reinforcement: rapid learning\n  - Intermittent reinforcement: more resistant to extinction\n  - Punishment (shock) decreases behavior\n- **Key Finding:** Behavior shaped by reinforcement (increases behavior) and punishment (decreases behavior)\n\n**Four Types:**\n1. **Positive Reinforcement:** Adding pleasant stimulus (employee gets bonus for meeting sales target)\n2. **Negative Reinforcement:** Removing unpleasant stimulus (driver buckles seatbelt to stop warning beep)\n3. **Positive Punishment:** Adding unpleasant stimulus (teenager gets extra chores for breaking curfew)\n4. **Negative Punishment:** Removing pleasant stimulus (driver loses money from speeding ticket)\n\n**Schedules of Reinforcement:** [Mentioned but not detailed in source]\n\n#### 4. Comparison: Classical vs Operant Conditioning\n- Both are associative learning\n- **CC:** Involuntary learning; stimulus guaranteed to produce response; UCS works same way for pleasurable/aversive; reinforcer presented regardless of behavior, before response\n- **OC:** Voluntary learning; likelihood of response depends on past consequences; pleasurable outcomes repeated, aversive avoided; reinforcer only if specific behavior emitted, after behavior\n\n#### 5. Preparedness (Seligman, 1970)\n**Concept:** Animals biologically prepared to learn actions related to species survival with little training. Contraprepared behaviors contrary to natural tendencies, learned with great difficulty.\n\n**Evidence - Animals:**\n- Mineka (1980s): Rhesus monkeys quickly learned to fear snakes after observing other monkeys' fearful reactions (video or live). Fear acquired after 1-2 exposures, persisted longer than fears of neutral stimuli (flowers)\n\n**Evidence - Humans:**\n- Ohman et al. (1975): Humans easily conditioned to fear spiders/snakes, but not flowers/houses/berries\n- Fear of heights: Easily strengthened (Gibson & Walk, 1960)\n- Fear of dark: Stronger fear responses to dark environments paired with aversive stimuli, more resistant to extinction (Grillon et al., 1997)\n- Evolutionary relevant vs modern stimuli: Snake fears stronger, acquired faster, more resistant to extinction than electrical outlet fears (Öhman & Mineka)\n\n#### 6. Cognitive Approaches\n\n**Social Learning Theory (Bandura, 1977):**\n- Focuses on observational learning (modeling)\n- Cognitive factors crucial\n- Example: Bobo doll experiment\n\n**Tolman's Cognitive Behaviourism - Latent Learning:**\n- Maze experiments with rats (1930s)\n- **Finding:** Group 3 learned maze layout during non-rewarded trials but didn't demonstrate learning until reward introduced\n- **Concept:** Latent learning - learning occurs without immediate reinforcement, expressed later when reinforcer introduced\n- **Cognitive Maps:** Mental representations of environment\n- **Contrast with Operant:** Challenges strict behaviorist view that immediate reinforcement necessary; learning can occur without immediate consequences\n\n**Kohler's Insight Learning (1925):**\n- Chimps demonstrated learning by INSIGHT\n- **Definition:** Sudden perception of useful relationship that helps solve problem\n- Not trial-and-error, but sudden understanding\n\n#### 7. Learned Helplessness (Seligman, 1960s)\n**Definition:** Condition where individual/animal, after repeated exposure to uncontrollable negative events, develops belief they cannot influence outcomes, leading to passivity and reduced motivation, even when control is possible.\n\n**Connections:**\n- **Classical Conditioning:** Associating aversive stimulus with lack of control → conditioned response of helplessness\n- **Operant Conditioning:** When actions consistently fail to produce desired outcomes, individual learns behavior has no effect → reduces future attempts (negative reinforcement of passivity)\n- **Cognitive Learning:** Perception and belief that one is powerless shapes expectations and behavior in new situations\n\n---\n\n## Week 4: Motivation (October 20-26)\n**Source:** PSYC100 GENERAL PSYCHOLOGY MOTIVATION.txt\n\n### Learning Outcomes\n1. What is motivation?\n2. Motivation theories\n3. Drive theory\n4. Instinct theory\n5. Arousal theory\n6. Expectancy-value theory\n7. Intrinsic-extrinsic motivation\n8. Achievement motivation\n\n### Key Concepts & Definitions\n\n#### 1. Motivation Definition\n**Definitions:**\n- \"Processes involved in the initiation, direction, and energization of individual behaviour\" (Geen, 1995)\n- \"Study of all those pushes and prods – biological, social and psychological – that defeat our laziness and move us, either eagerly or reluctantly, to action\" (Miller, 1962)\n\n**Categories (Rubin & McNeil, 1983):**\n1. Survival/physiological motives\n2. Competence/cognitive motives\n3. Social motives\n\n#### 2. Drive Theory (Clark Hull, 1943)\n**Core Concept:** Based on body's homeostasis\n\n**Homeostasis:** Natural tendency to keep body in state of equilibrium (liver, kidneys, brain)\n\n**Drive Theory:** Physiological disruptions to homeostasis produce drives (internal tensions that motivate organism to engage in behavior to reduce tension)\n\n**Examples:** Thirst, hunger\n\n**Evaluation:**\n- **Drawbacks:**\n  - Dieting contrary to drive to eat\n  - People often eat when not hungry\n- **Reductionist:** Oversimplifies complex behavior\n\n**Questions to consider:**\n- What makes you eat?\n- Why do you get hungry?\n- How much do social factors play a part in eating behavior?\n\n#### 3. Instinct Theory\n**Definition:** Instincts are automatic, involuntary, and unlearned patterns of behavior triggered by presence of particular stimuli\n\n**Examples:**\n- Babies born with instinct to cry (survival ability)\n- Coughing, blinking\n\n**Evolutionary Perspective (Buss, 1999):** Desire to pass on genes provides motivational forces for love, romantic relationships, attraction, marriage\n\n**Evaluation:**\n- **Drawbacks:**\n  - Ignores learning and environment\n  - Doesn't account for individual differences\n  - Empirical challenges: Hard to test innate responses, difficult to isolate from learned responses\n- **Reductionist**\n\n#### 4. Arousal Theory\n**Core Concept:** People take actions to either decrease or increase arousal levels\n\n**Optimal Arousal:** Motivated to maintain optimal level of arousal (varies by individual/situation)\n\n**Examples:**\n- Low arousal → watch exciting movie, go for jog\n- High arousal → meditate, read book\n- Parachute jumping (high arousal seeking)\n\n**Learning Component:** We learn what keeps our own arousal levels at optimum level\n\n**Evaluation:**\n- **Drawbacks:**\n  - Neglects emotional and social motivators\n  - Empirical testing challenges\n- **Reductionist**\n\n#### 5. Expectancy-Value Theory\n**Formula:** Motivation = Expectancy × Incentive Value\n\n**Definition:** Goal-directed behavior jointly determined by:\n1. Strength of person's expectation that behaviors will lead to goal\n2. Incentive value individual places on that goal (Brehm & Self, 1989)\n\n**Example:**\n- College student preparing for midterm\n- High expectancy: Consistently scored high on practice quizzes\n- High value: Exam worth 30% of grade, aims for postgraduate program\n- Result: Motivated to study hard\n- Contrast: Low confidence in math (low expectancy) + no interest in subject (low value) = skip studying\n\n**Evaluation:**\n- **Drawbacks:**\n  - Based on subjective experiences (student might overestimate skills)\n  - External influences (financial constraints affect motivation)\n  - Overemphasis on rationality (emotions, procrastination, impulsivity often larger role in college)\n  - Cultural and social variability\n\n#### 6. Intrinsic-Extrinsic Motivation\n**Extrinsic Motivation:** Performing activity to obtain external reward or avoid punishment\n\n**Intrinsic Motivation:** Performing activity for its own sake - because you find it enjoyable or challenging\n\n**Examples:**\n- **Intrinsic:** Student enrolls in creative writing because they love storytelling and find joy in crafting narratives, even if not required for major. Process of writing itself is rewarding.\n- **Extrinsic:** Student enrolls in creative writing because it's very easy and will get good grade.\n\n**Evaluation:**\n- **Drawbacks:**\n  - Over-simplification of motivation\n  - Individual differences: Students vary in response to intrinsic vs extrinsic motivators. Personality traits (conscientiousness) or cultural backgrounds (collectivist cultures valuing group recognition) influence which factors more motivating\n  - Contextual factors: External pressures like financial stress can overshadow both types. Student might love subject (intrinsic) but lack energy due to part-time work demands\n\n#### 7. Achievement Motivation (McClelland & Atkinson, 1953)\n**Concept:** Need for achievement\n\n**Components:**\n1. Positively oriented motive for success\n2. Negatively oriented motivation to avoid failure (fear of failure)\n\n**Measurement Method - TAT (Thematic Apperception Test):**\n- Projective psychological test\n- Individuals shown ambiguous pictures\n- Asked to create stories about them\n- Developed by David McClelland and John Atkinson\n\n**Evaluation:**\n- **Drawbacks:**\n  - TAT is subjective, relies on trained scorers (introduces variability)\n  - Measures unconscious motives (may not align with explicit behaviors or self-reported goals)\n  - Cultural differences in storytelling styles affect interpretation\n\n---\n\n## Summary Comparison Table\n\n### Week 3: Learning Theories Comparison\n\n| Theory | Type | Key Figure(s) | Voluntary? | Core Mechanism |\n|--------|------|--------------|-----------|---------------|\n| Classical Conditioning | Behaviorist | Pavlov, Watson | No (involuntary) | Association between stimuli |\n| Operant Conditioning | Behaviorist | Thorndike, Skinner | Yes (voluntary) | Consequences shape behavior |\n| Latent Learning | Cognitive | Tolman | Yes | Learning without immediate reinforcement |\n| Insight Learning | Cognitive | Kohler | Yes | Sudden understanding of relationships |\n| Social Learning | Cognitive-Social | Bandura | Yes | Observational learning |\n\n### Week 4: Motivation Theories Comparison\n\n| Theory | Focus | Strength | Limitation |\n|--------|-------|----------|-----------|\n| Drive Theory | Biological needs | Explains basic drives (hunger, thirst) | Reductionist, doesn't explain all eating behavior |\n| Instinct Theory | Innate patterns | Explains universal behaviors | Ignores learning, individual differences |\n| Arousal Theory | Optimal stimulation | Explains thrill-seeking | Neglects emotional/social factors |\n| Expectancy-Value | Cognitive calculation | Explains goal-directed behavior | Overemphasizes rationality |\n| Intrinsic-Extrinsic | Source of motivation | Distinguishes internal/external drives | Oversimplifies complex motivation |\n| Achievement Motivation | Success/failure orientation | Explains achievement behavior | Measurement challenges (TAT subjectivity) |\n\n---\n\n## Important Studies Referenced\n\n### Week 3 Studies\n1. **Watson & Rayner (1920):** Little Albert - conditioning fear\n2. **Jones (1924):** Little Peter - unconditioning fear through systematic desensitization\n3. **Thorndike:** Puzzle box experiments - Law of Effect\n4. **Skinner:** Operant conditioning chamber experiments\n5. **Seligman (1970):** Preparedness concept\n6. **Mineka (1980s):** Rhesus monkeys and snake fears\n7. **Ohman et al.

Learning is a relatively permanent change in behavior through experience, excluding maturation, fatigue, and temporary states\n2. Classical conditioning (Pavlov) involves involuntary learning through association of stimuli (UCS→UCR, CS→CR)\n3. Operant conditioning (Thorndike, Skinner) involves voluntary learning shaped by consequences - reinforcement increases behavior, punishment decreases it\n4. Cognitive approaches (Tolman, Kohler) demonstrate learning can occur without immediate reinforcement through insight and cognitive maps\n\n### Major Sections for Content Array:\n1. **What is Learning?** - Definition, exclusions (maturation/fatigue/temporary states)\n2. **Classical Conditioning** - Pavlov's experiments, UCS/UCR/CS/CR, generalization/discrimination/extinction/spontaneous recovery\n3. **Applications of Classical Conditioning** - Little Albert (conditioning fear), Little Peter (systematic desensitization), exposure therapy\n4. **Operant Conditioning** - Thorndike's Law of Effect, Skinner's experiments, 4 types (positive/negative reinforcement/punishment)\n5. **Classical vs Operant Comparison** - Voluntary vs involuntary, timing of reinforcement\n6. **Preparedness** - Seligman's concept, evolutionary-relevant fears (snakes/heights/dark)\n7. **Cognitive Approaches** - Tolman's latent learning, Kohler's insight learning, Bandura's social learning\n8. **Learned Helplessness** - Definition, connections to CC/OC/cognitive learning\n\n### Key Studies to Reference:\n- Watson & Rayner (1920) - Little Albert\n- Jones (1924) - Little Peter\n- Thorndike - Puzzle boxes\n- Skinner - Operant conditioning chamber\n- Seligman (1970) - Preparedness\n- Mineka (1980s) - Monkey snake fears\n- Ohman et al. (1975) - Human conditioning to evolutionary stimuli\n- Tolman (1930s) - Latent learning\n- Kohler (1925) - Insight learning in chimps\n- Bandura (1977) - Social learning, Bobo doll\n\n### Sample Questions (15+ needed):\n1. What is the definition of learning according to Ormrod (2016)?\n2. Which of the following is NOT an example of learning? (maturation/learning to ride bike/fear conditioning/reading)\n3. In Pavlov's experiment, what was the unconditioned stimulus (UCS)?\n4. What is the conditioned response (CR) in classical conditioning?\n5. What does \"extinction\" mean in classical conditioning?\n6. What was the purpose of the Little Albert experiment?\n7. Who demonstrated that phobias could be reversed through systematic desensitization?\n8. What is Thorndike's Law of Effect?\n9. Which type of consequence increases behavior? (reinforcement/punishment)\n10. What is positive reinforcement? (Give example)\n11. What is negative punishment? (Give example)\n12. How does classical conditioning differ from operant conditioning?\n13. What is preparedness according to Seligman?\n14. What did Tolman demonstrate with his maze experiments?\n15. What is latent learning?\n16. What is insight learning according to Kohler?\n17. What is learned helplessness?\n\n---\n\n## WEEK 4: MOTIVATION (Oct 20-26)\n**File:** `PSYC100 GENERAL PSYCHOLOGY MOTIVATION.txt`\n\n### Topic ID: `motivation-psychology`\n### Title: \"Motivation\"\n### Subtitle: \"Theories of Motivation: Drive, Instinct, Arousal, Expectancy-Value, and Achievement\"\n\n### Key Takeaways (3-4 bullet points):\n1. Motivation involves processes of initiation, direction, and energization of behavior, with three categories: survival/physiological, competence/cognitive, and social motives\n2. Drive theory (Hull) explains behavior through homeostasis disruptions creating internal tensions, while instinct theory focuses on automatic, unlearned patterns\n3. Arousal theory suggests people maintain optimal arousal levels, while expectancy-value theory proposes Motivation = Expectancy × Value\n4. Intrinsic motivation (performing for enjoyment) differs from extrinsic motivation (performing for external rewards), and achievement motivation involves both success orientation and fear of failure\n\n### Major Sections for Content Array:\n1. **What is Motivation?** - Definitions (Geen, Miller, Rubin & McNeil), three categories of motives\n2. **Drive Theory** - Hull's homeostasis concept, examples (hunger/thirst), evaluation/limitations\n3. **Instinct Theory** - Definition, examples (baby crying, coughing, blinking), evolutionary perspective (Buss), limitations\n4. **Arousal Theory** - Optimal arousal concept, examples (high/low arousal activities), learning component\n5. **Expectancy-Value Theory** - Formula (Motivation = Expectancy × Value), college student example, limitations\n6. **Intrinsic vs Extrinsic Motivation** - Definitions, creative writing course examples, evaluation\n7. **Achievement Motivation** - McClelland & Atkinson's concepts, TAT measurement, limitations\n\n### Key Theorists to Reference:\n- Clark Hull (1943) - Drive theory\n- Buss (1999) - Evolutionary perspective\n- Brehm & Self (1989) - Expectancy-value\n- McClelland & Atkinson (1953) - Achievement motivation, TAT\n- Geen (1995), Miller (1962), Rubin & McNeil (1983) - Motivation definitions\n\n### Sample Questions (15+ needed):\n1. According to Geen (1995), what is motivation?\n2. What are the three categories of motives identified by Rubin & McNeil?\n3. What is homeostasis?\n4. What does drive theory propose about physiological disruptions?\n5. What is a major limitation of drive theory? (explain dieting example)\n6. What are instincts according to instinct theory?\n7. Give an example of an instinct in babies.\n8. What is a limitation of instinct theory?\n9. According to arousal theory, what do people seek to maintain?\n10. Give an example of a high arousal activity.\n11. What is the formula for expectancy-value theory?\n12. In the expectancy-value college student example, why was the student motivated?\n13. What is intrinsic motivation?\n14. What is extrinsic motivation?\n15. Which motivation type involves external rewards?\n16. What are the two components of achievement motivation?\n17. What is the TAT (Thematic Apperception Test)?\n18. What is a limitation of the TAT?\n\n---\n\n## Implementation Notes for JSON Generation Agents:\n\n### Content Structure Requirements:\n- Each week needs `week`, `dateRange`, `topics` array\n- Each topic needs `id`, `title`, `subtitle`, `summary`, `keyTakeaways` (array), `content` (array), `questions` (array)\n- Content types: `heading`, `paragraph`, `list`, `callout`\n- Callout types: `Info`, `AlertCircle`\n- Questions: Need 15+ MCQs with `question`, `options` (array of 4), `answer`\n\n### Content Writing Guidelines:\n- Write in clear, academic but accessible language\n- Use present tense for definitions and concepts\n- Include specific examples from the source material\n- Reference key studies and theorists\n- Make questions unambiguous with single correct answer\n- Avoid trick questions - test understanding, not memory tricks\n\n### Quality Checks:\n✓ All key concepts covered from source material\n✓ Learning outcomes addressed\n✓ Examples and studies included\n✓ Questions test different levels of understanding\n✓ No ambiguous or poorly-worded questions\n✓ Structure matches existing week1.json format exactly\n"}}],"stop_reason":"tool_use","stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":0,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1184,"cache_read_input_tokens":78472,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1184,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":2094,"service_tier":"standard"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"55900f5d-919a-45f7-ace7-de13cef84fb2","uuid":"d08fd060-fbfc-432f-994f-debc1dff7ecc"}
