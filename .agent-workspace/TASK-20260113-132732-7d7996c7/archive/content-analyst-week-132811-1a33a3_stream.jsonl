Defining intelligence\n2. Four major theories of intelligence (Spearman, Cattell, Sternberg, Gardner)\n3. Intelligence testing methods (Stanford-Binet, Wechsler, Raven's)\n4. Gender and racial differences in IQ\n5. The Flynn Effect\n\n### Definition of Intelligence\n**Standard Definition:** \"A very general mental capability that involves the ability to reason, plan, solve problems, think abstractly, comprehend complex ideas, learn quickly, and learn from experience.\"\n\n---\n\n## Key Concepts & Theories\n\n### 1. Spearman's Two-Factor Theory (1904)\n- **Core Concept:** All intellectual activities share a common underlying factor\n- **Components:**\n  - **General Intelligence (g):** Single general intelligence influencing performance on every cognitive task\n  - **Specific Abilities (s):** Many specific abilities unique to each task\n- **Summary:** Performance on any mental task depends on how intelligent you are overall (g) plus how skilled you are in that specific area (s)\n\n### 2. Cattell's Fluid and Crystallized Intelligence Theory (gf-gc theory, 1963)\n- **Core Concept:** General intelligence (g) can be subdivided into two major dimensions\n- **Components:**\n  - **Fluid Intelligence (gf):** The ability to reason, think abstractly, and solve novel problems—independent of prior knowledge or experience\n  - **Crystallized Intelligence (gc):** The ability to use learned knowledge, skills, and experience. Grows through education and cultural exposure\n\n### 3. Sternberg's Triarchic Theory\n- **Three types of intelligences** (specific types not detailed in lecture)\n\n### 4. Gardner's Multiple Intelligences Theory\n- **Eight types of intelligences** (specific types not detailed in lecture)\n\n---\n\n## Intelligence Testing\n\n### Stanford-Binet Test\n- **Origin:** Simon-Binet test (1905) - first INDIVIDUAL intelligence test\n  - Commissioned by French government to identify children who wouldn't benefit from ordinary schooling\n- **History:** Revisions led to Stanford-Binet test\n  - 4th revision (1986)\n  - 5th edition (2003) - current version\n- **Structure:**\n  - Verbal and nonverbal scales are balanced (based on gf-gc theory)\n  - Mean = 100, SD = 15\n  - Provides: Verbal IQ, Nonverbal IQ, Full-Scale IQ\n\n### Army Alpha and Army Beta Tests (Historical)\n- **Historical Significance:** Very first GROUP intelligence tests in history\n- **Period:** Developed 1917-1919 by U.S. Army during World War I\n- **Purpose:** Screen and classify over 1.7 million recruits\n- **Types:**\n  - **Army Alpha:** Designed for literate recruits (could read and write English well)\n  - **Army Beta:** Designed for illiterate recruits or non-English speakers (mostly recent immigrants from Southern/Eastern Europe and some African Americans)\n\n### Wechsler Tests\n- **Status:** The most commonly used IQ tests globally\n- **Structure:** Balanced verbal and nonverbal scales\n- **Most Recent Versions:**\n  - **WPPSI-IV (2012):** Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence - ages 2.5-6 years\n  - **WISC-V (2014):** Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children - ages 6-16 years\n  - **WAIS-V (2024):** Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale - ages 16-90 years\n\n### Raven's Progressive Matrices\n- **Versions:**\n  - Standard Progressive Matrices (SPM)\n  - Advanced Progressive Matrices (APM)\n  - Colored Progressive Matrices (CPM for children)\n- **Developer:** Raven (1938; 1998)\n- **Key Features:**\n  - Non-verbal\n  - Culture-reduced\n\n---\n\n## Gender Differences in IQ\n\n### Construction Bias\n- Most IQ tests have been constructed so that there are no differences in scores between genders\n- Any difference between genders may only have been negligible (Terman, 1916)\n- Meta-analyses reporting scores for men average 5 IQ points more than women (Irwing & Lynn, 2005) have small effect sizes\n\n### Male Advantages\n1. **Visuo-spatial tasks** (e.g., mental rotation)\n   - Mean of male distribution on mental rotation is almost one standard deviation above that for females (Masters and Sanders, 1993)\n   - Applications: Constructing models, furniture assembly\n2. **Mechanical reasoning** (e.g., maintaining, repairing, operating equipment)\n3. **Quantitative tasks** (mathematics)\n\n### Female Advantages\n1. **Verbal tasks:** Synonym generation and verbal fluency\n   - Mean of female distribution is between 0.5 and 1.2 standard deviations above that of males\n2. **Memory tasks:** Females may perform better than males on some memory tasks\n\n### Explanations for Gender Differences\n\n#### Biological Factors\n- **Brain size:** Males have ~10% larger brains on average, correlating with ~0.3-0.4 IQ points per gram (though females have higher neuronal density)\n- **Hormones:**\n  - Prenatal testosterone exposure predicts better spatial skills and male-typical play\n  - Estrogen supports verbal memory\n- **Evolution:** Hunter-gatherer hypothesis\n  - Male spatial edges from navigation/hunting\n  - Female verbal from social/child-rearing roles\n  - Supported by cross-cultural consistency\n\n#### Environmental Factors\n- **Socialization:** Girls encouraged in language arts, boys in STEM toys (e.g., LEGO studies show early gaps)\n- **Education:** Gaps narrow in gender-equal societies (e.g., PISA data from Nordic countries), but high-end math differences persist\n- **Gender differentiated toys**\n\n---\n\n## Racial Differences in IQ\n\n### Controversial Historical Claims\n- **Jensen (1969):** Suggested white children were more intelligent than black children, and Asian children were more intelligent than either. Claimed differences were largely due to genetic factors\n- **Herrnstein and Murray (1994):** The Bell Curve\n  - Suggested a difference of one standard deviation between mean IQ scores of Blacks (mean = 85) and Whites (mean = 100) in USA\n  - Suggested the differences are genetic in origin\n\n### American Psychological Association Response\n- **Action:** Assembled a task force to investigate Herrnstein and Murray's findings (Neisser et al., 1996)\n- **Findings:** Task force agreed that there were differences between average IQ scores of African Americans and white Americans, but suggest that differences may be due to cultural factors\n\n### Three Possible Explanations\n\n#### 1. Test Bias\n- IQ tests are not neutral but reflect the cultural knowledge, language, and experiences of the dominant group (typically White, middle-class Americans)\n- Disadvantages minority groups\n- Differences in scores do not measure true intelligence but familiarity with test content\n\n#### 2. Genetics (Rejected by Scientific Consensus)\n- This view argues that racial groups have evolved genetic differences in cognitive abilities due to historical selection pressures\n- **Scientific Refutation:**\n  - Race is primarily a social construct, not a biological one\n  - No genes for \"intelligence\" have been identified that differ systematically by race\n  - Source: Nisbett, R. E., et al. (2012). \"Intelligence: New findings and theoretical developments.\" American Psychologist, 67(6), 503-504\n\n#### 3. Environment (Consensus View)\n- Attributes gaps to unequal access to resources, education, health, and opportunity, which shape cognitive development from prenatal stages onward\n- Racial categories proxy for systemic inequities (e.g., racism, poverty)\n- **Scientific Consensus:** The overwhelming scientific consensus is that environmental factors, compounded by historical and ongoing inequities, account for nearly all racial IQ differences\n\n---\n\n## The Flynn Effect\n\n### Core Finding\n- **Rate:** IQ has increased over time, on average around 3 IQ points per decade\n- **Type of Gains:** Largest gains in fluid intelligence (reasoning, pattern recognition—e.g., Raven's Matrices), NOT crystallized (vocabulary, facts)\n- **Geographic Scope:** Observed in 30+ countries, including developing nations\n- **Recent Trend:** Slowing or reversing in some developed nations (Norway, Denmark, UK) since the late 1990s\n\n### Explanations for Flynn Effect\n1. **Nutrition:** Better prenatal and childhood nutrition → brain growth\n2. **Education:** Longer schooling, abstract thinking training\n3. **Cognitive Stimulation:** TV, puzzles, video games, VR\n4. **Smaller families:** More parental attention per child\n5. **Test familiarity:** Practice with multiple-choice, abstract problems\n\n---\n\n## Heredity vs. Environment\n\n### Key Points\n- Both heredity and environment contribute to intelligence\n- Heredity and environment interact in various ways\n- As people's genetic similarity increases, generally so does the similarity of their environments\n\n### Research Evidence\n- **Twin Studies:** Comparing IQs of Monozygotic twins reared apart (MZsRA) with Dizygotic twins\n  - MZsRA are still more similar than same-sex Dizygotics reared together, suggesting a strong genetic influence\n  - **Critique:** Studies of MZsRA have been criticized on several important methodological grounds\n- **Adoption Studies:** Provide further support for genetic influence\n  - **Environmental Impact:** When children from disadvantaged parents are adopted into high SES families, substantial gains in IQ can occur\n\n---\n\n## Important Applications & Examples\n1. First individual IQ test: Simon-Binet test (1905)\n2. First group IQ tests: Army Alpha/Beta (WWI, 1917-1919)\n3. Most widely used IQ tests: Wechsler series (WPPSI, WISC, WAIS)\n4. Culture-reduced testing: Raven's Progressive Matrices\n\n---\n---\n\n## WEEK 10: PSYCHOPATHOLOGY (Dec 22 - Dec 28)\n\n### Learning Outcomes\n1. What is abnormality? (7 definitions)\n2. Classification of mental disorders (DSM-5, ICD)\n3. Anxiety disorders (7 types)\n4. Obsessive-compulsive and related disorders (5 types)\n5. Depressive and bipolar disorders (4 types)\n6. Schizophrenia spectrum (5 types)\n7. Personality disorders (10 types in 3 clusters)\n\n---\n\n## What is Abnormality?\n\n### Seven Definitions\n\n#### 1. Abnormality as Deviation from the (Statistical) Average\n- Rarity/infrequency\n- **Problem:** Gifted individuals are statistically rare, but not considered abnormal\n- **Problem:** Common things like anxiety are considered as disorders\n\n#### 2. Abnormality as Deviation from the Norm\n- Society's norms and rule-breaking\n- **Problem:** Is rule breaking bad? Is having a panic attack also bad?\n\n#### 3. Abnormality as Deviation from Ideal Mental Health\n- **Problem:** Varies across cultures\n\n#### 4. Abnormality as Personal Distress\n- Subjective suffering\n- **Example:** Obsessive-compulsive behavior\n\n#### 5. Abnormality as Others' Stress\n- Interpersonal aspect\n- **Example:** Narcissistic personality disorder\n\n#### 6. Abnormality as Maladaptiveness\n- Impaired functioning\n- **Example:** Substance use\n\n#### 7. Abnormality as Unexpected Behavior\n- Out of proportion responses\n- **Example:** Anxiety in anxiety disorders is out of proportion\n\n**Key Insight:** Multiple perspectives are needed - no single definition is sufficient\n\n---\n\n## Classification of Mental Disorders\n\n### Historical Context\n- **Kraepelin (1883):** Published the first recognized textbook of psychiatry\n  - Claimed that certain groups of symptoms occur together sufficiently often to be called a \"disease\" or syndrome\n  - His classification formed the basis for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) and the International Classification of Diseases (ICD)\n\n### DSM-5 (Current System)\n- **Total Categories:** 20 major categories\n- **Parallel System:** ICD (International Classification of Diseases)\n\n#### DSM-5 Major Categories\n1. Neurodevelopmental Disorders (e.g., ADHD, autism)\n2. Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders\n3. Bipolar and Related Disorders\n4. Depressive Disorders\n5. Anxiety Disorders\n6. Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders\n7. Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorders\n8. Dissociative Disorders\n9. Somatic Symptom and Related Disorders\n10. Feeding and Eating Disorders\n11. Elimination Disorders\n12. Sleep-Wake Disorders\n13. Sexual Dysfunctions\n14. Gender Dysphoria\n15. Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorders\n16. Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders\n17. Neurocognitive Disorders\n18. Personality Disorders\n19. Paraphilic Disorders\n20.

Week 9 has strong emphasis on controversial topics (gender/race differences) - questions must be academically accurate and unbiased\n2. Week 10 has extensive disorder classification - questions should test understanding of distinguishing features, not just memorization\n3. Both weeks include historical context that provides good question material\n4. Examples and case vignettes in Week 10 are excellent for scenario-based questions\n5. Duration criteria and symptom counts are objective facts suitable for clear-cut questions\n"}}],"stop_reason":"tool_use","stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":0,"cache_creation_input_tokens":825,"cache_read_input_tokens":87483,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":825,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8243,"service_tier":"standard"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"3ae41dfd-c210-436e-b840-8d09118334e5","uuid":"ddcdad35-eb8e-4a0e-aa70-5e06ea1ea67a"}
