It involves selective\n    30→attention and relates to questions like \"How is sensory information processed in a\n    31→way that allows it to be stored?\" or \"How are things remembered?\"\n    32→\n    33→\n    34→\n    35→Storage: This process involves retaining information in memory over time. It relates\n    36→to questions such as \"Where are our memories kept?\" and \"Is there more than one\n    37→kind of memory?\"\n    38→\n    39→\n    40→\n    41→Retrieval: This is the process of recovering stored information when needed.

Most\n    47→people probably can recall what they had for breakfast yesterday, even though\n    48→they haven’t tried to remember it. Other information will only become encoded if\n    49→you pay attention to it.\n    50→There are three ways of encoding information to be used by our memory system:\n    51→➢ acoustic encoding – encoding of sound\n    52→➢ visual encoding – encoding of picture images\n    53→➢ semantic encoding – encoding of meaning\n    54→\n    55→\fExamples\n    56→Acoustic Encoding: If you are repeating someone’s phone number aloud.\n    57→Visual Encoding: Picturing the face of someone you met or imagining the\n    58→layout of a room you visited.\n    59→Semantic Encoding: Understanding and recalling that \"justice\" means fairness\n    60→or remembering the concept of \"photosynthesis\" as how plants make food.\n    61→\n    62→\fII - STORAGE\n    63→\n    64→\n    65→There are 3 forms of storage:\n    66→\n    67→1. Sensory memory - This is the initial stage where sensory information (sight, sound,\n    68→etc.) is briefly held for a very short period, typically less than a second to a few seconds. It\n    69→acts as a buffer, allowing us to process and decide what to pay attention to.\n    70→2. Short-term memory - This holds information for a limited time, usually 20-30 seconds,\n    71→and has a small capacity (about 5-9 items). It’s where we actively think about or manipulate\n    72→information, like remembering a phone number long enough to dial it.\n    73→3. Long-term memory - This stores information for an extended period, potentially a\n    74→lifetime, with a vast capacity. It includes knowledge, skills, and experiences, and is\n    75→accessed when we recall past events or learned facts.\n    76→\n    77→\fSTM vs LTM\n    78→●\n    79→\n    80→capacity – how much information can be stored\n    81→\n    82→●\n    83→\n    84→duration – how long the information can be held in storage\n    85→\n    86→●\n    87→\n    88→coding – how sensory input is represented by the memory system.\n    89→\n    90→\fShort-term memory CAPACITY\n    91→ George Miller (1956) emphasized that the capacity of the STM is\n    92→\n    93→approximately “seven plus or minus two” pieces of information – digits,\n    94→words etc. (the magic number 7+/-2).\n    95→\n    96→\fShort-term memory CAPACITY\n    97→Chunking of information can lead to an increase in the STM capacity. This\n    98→is the reason why a hyphenated phone number is EASIER to remember\n    99→than a single long number.\n   100→\n   101→\fShort-term memory DURATION\n   102→The duration of STM is thought to be 15-30 seconds. If information is not\n   103→rehearsed within 18 to 30 seconds whilst in STM, it is lost due to its limited\n   104→duration. Short-term memory encodes information acoustically through\n   105→repetition of information. If we rehearse (repeat) this information (say it over\n   106→and over to ourselves), we can store it in our short-term memory for many\n   107→minutes and it can then be transferred to the long-term memory store (almost\n   108→indefinitely) (Peterson & Peterson, 1959).\n   109→\n   110→\fShort-term memory CODING\n   111→ Mainly acoustic (e.g. When you try to remember a phone\n   112→\n   113→number by repeating it in your head); Some semantic\n   114→(encoding by meaning); Visual is also possible (e.g. briefly\n   115→remembering an image or shape.)\n   116→\n   117→\fLong-term memory CAPACITY &\n   118→DURATION\n   119→The capacity of LTM could be unlimited as it can hold a potentially\n   120→unlimited amount of information.\n   121→Duration: Long-term memory can store memories for minutes or up to an\n   122→entire lifetime.\n   123→\n   124→\fLong-term memory CODING\n   125→Encoding in long-term memory is largely semantic (e.g. You remember that “a\n   126→whale is a mammal” because of what it means, not how it sounds), but can be\n   127→visual (e.g. remembering what your childhood home looks like) or acoustic\n   128→(e.g. remembering the tune of a favorite song).\n   129→\n   130→\f\fRETRIEVAL\n   131→Retrieval refers to getting information out of storage. If we\n   132→cannot remember something, it may be because we are unable\n   133→to retrieve it.\n   134→e.g. Ebbinghaus study (1885)\n   135→e.g. Standing study (1973)\n   136→\n   137→\f\fThe Multi-Store Model (MSM)\n   138→Richard Atkinson and Richard Shiffrin developed the Multi-store Model of Memory\n   139→(1968) by drawing conclusions from memory experiments conducted by other\n   140→researchers. This model is a structural model and Atkinson and Shiffrin described\n   141→memory as having separate stores.\n   142→By pulling together this research, they were able to identify three distinctly different\n   143→stores in our memory system:\n   144→• the sensory register (or sensory memory)\n   145→• short-term memory\n   146→• long-term memory\n   147→\n   148→\fThe Multi-Store Model (MSM)\n   149→Atkinson and Shiffrin proposed\n   150→that memory stores differ from\n   151→each other in the way\n   152→information is encoded, their\n   153→capacity and duration, and how\n   154→information is retrieved.\n   155→\n   156→\fExperimental studies of STM and LTM\n   157→1.

Experimental studies of STM and\n   162→LTM\n   163→The Serial Position Effect (Murdock, 1962): Participants typically recalled\n   164→those items from the end of the list first, and got more of these correct than\n   165→earlier items (the recency effect). Items from the beginning of the list were\n   166→recalled quite well relative to those in the middle (the primacy effect), but not as\n   167→well as those at the end. Poorest recall is for items in the middle.\n   168→Primacy effect due to LTM, recency effect due to STM.\n   169→\n   170→\f2. Studies of coding\n   171→Remember acoustic coding in STM, semantic coding in LTM!\n   172→However, Miller and Selfridge (1950) has demonstrated that knowledge of\n   173→semantic and grammatical structure (presumably stored in LTM) is used to aid\n   174→recall from STM. Therefore, an acoustic code isn’t the only one used in STM.\n   175→\n   176→\f3. Studies of brain-damaged patients.\n   177→If STM and LTM really are distinct, then there should be certain kinds of brain damage which\n   178→impair one without affecting the other. One such form of brain damage is anterograde amnesia.\n   179→HM case where after the brain operation, he was unable to form new explicit long-term\n   180→memories, however his immediate or working memory remained functional (STM intact, old LTM\n   181→intact, new LTM severely impaired).\n   182→HM's deficits strongly support the MSM by demonstrating a clear dissociation between STM and\n   183→LTM, suggesting they are separate systems\n   184→\n   185→\fEpisodic, Semantic & Procedural\n   186→Memory\n   187→ The multi-store model of memory, as supported by cases like HM,\n   188→\n   189→distinguishes between short-term and long-term memory, with\n   190→long-term memory (LTM) further divided into subtypes based on\n   191→the type of information stored and how it is retrieved. The three\n   192→main types of long-term memory are episodic, semantic, and\n   193→procedural.\n   194→\n   195→\fEpisodic Memory\n   196→ The storage and recall of personally experienced events tied to specific times and\n   197→\n   198→places. These are autobiographical memories that include contextual details (e.g.,\n   199→\"what,\" \"when,\" \"where,\" and associated emotions).

Understand what memory is (encoding, storage, retrieval)\n2. Explain the Multi-Store Model (MSM) of memory\n3. Differentiate between episodic, semantic, and procedural memory\n4. Describe the Working Memory Model (WMM)\n5. Understand the Levels of Processing Model (LOP)\n6. Explain theories of forgetting\n\n---\n\n### KEY CONCEPTS - MEMORY\n\n#### 1. **What is Memory?**\n- **Definition**: Three interrelated processes for managing information\n- **Registration/Encoding**: Transformation of sensory input into storable format\n- **Storage**: Retaining information over time\n- **Retrieval**: Extracting stored information when needed\n\n**Types of Encoding:**\n- **Acoustic encoding**: encoding of sound (e.g., repeating phone number aloud)\n- **Visual encoding**: encoding of images (e.g., picturing a face)\n- **Semantic encoding**: encoding of meaning (e.g., understanding \"justice\" means fairness)\n\n---\n\n#### 2. **Three Forms of Storage**\n\n**A. Sensory Memory**\n- Initial stage where sensory information briefly held\n- Duration: less than 1 second to a few seconds\n- Acts as buffer for processing\n\n**B. Short-Term Memory (STM)**\n- **Capacity**: 7±2 items (Miller, 1956) - \"magic number\"\n- **Duration**: 15-30 seconds without rehearsal (Peterson & Peterson, 1959)\n- **Coding**: Mainly acoustic, some semantic, visual possible\n- **Chunking**: Grouping information increases capacity (e.g., hyphenated phone numbers)\n- Information lost if not rehearsed within 18-30 seconds\n\n**C. Long-Term Memory (LTM)**\n- **Capacity**: Potentially unlimited\n- **Duration**: Minutes to entire lifetime\n- **Coding**: Largely semantic, but also visual and acoustic\n- Examples: knowing \"whale is mammal\" (semantic), childhood home appearance (visual), favorite song tune (acoustic)\n\n---\n\n#### 3. **The Multi-Store Model (MSM)**\n**Developers**: Atkinson & Shiffrin (1968)\n\n**Structure**:\n- Sensory Register → Short-Term Memory → Long-Term Memory\n- Information flows through rehearsal from STM to LTM\n\n**Supporting Evidence**:\n1. **Serial Position Effect (Murdock, 1962)**\n   - Primacy effect: good recall of beginning items (LTM)\n   - Recency effect: best recall of end items (STM)\n   - Poor recall of middle items\n\n2. **Coding Studies (Miller & Selfridge, 1950)**\n   - Acoustic coding in STM\n   - Semantic coding in LTM\n   - Some overlap showing semantic structure aids STM recall\n\n3. **Brain-Damaged Patients: HM Case**\n   - Anterograde amnesia after brain surgery\n   - STM intact, old LTM intact, NEW LTM severely impaired\n   - Strong evidence for separate memory systems\n\n---\n\n#### 4. **Types of Long-Term Memory**\n\n**A. Episodic Memory (Explicit/Declarative)**\n- Storage of personally experienced events with time/place context\n- Includes \"what,\" \"when,\" \"where,\" and emotions\n- **Examples**:\n  - Autobiographical: First day of university, how lecturer looked\n  - Flashbulb memories: Death of celebrity (Michael Jackson, Princess Diana)\n\n**B. Semantic Memory (Explicit/Declarative)**\n- General knowledge, facts, concepts\n- NOT tied to personal experience or specific context\n- **Examples**:\n  - Knowing 2+2=4\n  - Knowing \"cat\" refers to furry animal\n\n**C. Procedural Memory (Implicit/Non-Declarative)**\n- Unconscious recall of skills and habits\n- Learned through practice\n- Expressed through performance, not conscious recollection\n- **Examples**:\n  - Riding bicycle\n  - Chess pattern recognition\n  - Brushing teeth routine\n\n---\n\n#### 5. **The Working Memory Model (WMM)**\n**Developers**: Baddeley & Hitch (1974; 2000)\n\n**Key Insight**: STM is ACTIVE system that manipulates/processes info, not just passive storage\n\n**Components**:\n1. **Central Executive**: Manager; directs attention; coordinates subsystems; limited capacity\n2. **Phonological Loop**: Stores spoken words briefly; allows rehearsal\n3. **Visuo-Spatial Sketchpad**: Holds and manipulates visual images\n4. **Episodic Buffer**: Integrates info from different sources (sound, vision, LTM) into single episode\n\n**MSM vs WMM Comparison**:\n- **MSM**: STM is single, passive store; focus on structure (where info goes); simple, linear\n- **WMM**: STM is active with multiple components; focus on process (how info handled); detailed, dynamic\n\n**Example - Shopping List**:\n- **MSM approach**: Hear list → sensory memory → rehearse in STM → transfer to LTM\n- **WMM approach**: Phonological loop repeats items; central executive maintains focus; episodic buffer links \"milk\" with image of empty fridge\n\n---\n\n#### 6. **The Levels of Processing Model (LOP)**\n**Developers**: Craik & Lockhart (1972)\n\n**Key Challenge to MSM**:\n- Jenkins (1974): Incidental learning occurs (remembering WITHOUT rehearsing)\n- What matters is TYPE of rehearsal/processing, not just repetition\n- Deep, semantic processing achieves LTM without simple rehearsal\n\n**Key Evidence - Craik & Tulving (1975)**:\nParticipants answered different questions about words:\n- **Shallow (structural)**: \"Is word in capital letters?\" → Poor recall\n- **Intermediate (phonemic)**: \"Does word rhyme with 'cat'?\" → Moderate recall\n- **Deep (semantic)**: \"Does word fit: 'The ___ walked into room'?\" → Best recall\n\n**Result**: Words processed semantically remembered MUCH better\n**Conclusion**: Depth of processing, not rehearsal, determines memory strength\n**Impact**: Strong evidence AGAINST MSM's rehearsal requirement\n\n**Example - Word \"elephant\"**:\n- **MSM**: Repeat \"elephant\" until transfers to LTM\n- **LOP**: Think about elephant's appearance, size, connect with zoo → more memorable\n\n---\n\n#### 7. **Theories of Forgetting**\n\nForgetting can occur at encoding, storage, or retrieval stages.\n\n**A. Decay Theory (STM + LTM)**\n- Memories fade over time without access/rehearsal\n- Natural deterioration of memory traces\n\n**B. Displacement Theory (STM)**\n- New information pushes out old information\n- Exceeds limited STM capacity\n- Relevant to STM's 7±2 capacity limit\n\n**C. Interference Theory (LTM)**\n- New or old information disrupts recall of other memories\n\n**Two Types**:\n1. **Proactive Interference**: OLD interferes with NEW\n   - Examples: Old phone number pops up when recalling new one; old password blocks new password recall\n\n2. **Retroactive Interference**: NEW interferes with OLD\n   - Examples: New language vocabulary makes old language harder; new dance steps cause forgetting of old ones\n\n**Efficient Forgetting Concept**:\n- Schacter (2002): Efficient forgetting is CRUCIAL for functioning memory\n- People with hyperthymestic syndrome (HSAM) lack this ability\n- Superior autobiographical memory can be problematic\n\n---\n\n## WEEK 5 PART 2 / WEEK 6: PERCEPTION\n\n### Learning Objectives\n1. Define perception and understand Gestalt Psychology\n2. Identify Gestalt principles of perceptual organization\n3. Explain depth perception using pictorial and non-pictorial cues\n4. Understand perceptual constancy principles\n5. Analyze visual illusions\n6. Compare ecological and constructivist theories of visual perception\n\n---\n\n### KEY CONCEPTS - PERCEPTION\n\n#### 1. **What is Perception?**\n- **Definition**: Organization and interpretation of sensory information to form inner representations of external world\n- **Key Insight**: We don't perceive 'reality' but how our brain interprets it (Macknik & Martinez-Conde, 2014)\n- **Ehrenfels (1890)**: Groups of stimuli acquire pattern quality GREATER than sum of parts\n  - Example: Melody - individual notes vs. recognizable tune\n\n**Important Terminology**:\n- **Distal stimulus**: The actual object you're looking at\n- **Proximal stimulus**: Pattern of stimulation hitting the retina\n- **Perceptual Challenge**: Distal stimulus constant, but proximal stimulus varies → how does perception remain constant?\n\n---\n\n#### 2. **Gestalt Principles of Perceptual Organization**\n\n**Core Concept**: Brain organizes sensory information into meaningful wholes\n\n**6 Key Principles**:\n\n**1. Figure-Ground Separation**\n- First perceptual task: recognize figure as distinct from background\n- Must perceive figure separately from surroundings (ground)\n\n**2. Proximity (Law of Perception)**\n- Elements close together perceived as group\n- Example: Dots placed near each other seen as clusters\n\n**3. Closure (Law of Perception)**\n- Tend to complete incomplete forms and fill gaps\n- Example: Perceive complete circle/rectangle rather than segments\n\n**4. Similarity (Law of Perception)**\n- Similar parts perceived as belonging together\n- Dissimilar parts perceived separately\n- Example: Array of colored dots seen as alternating rows by color\n\n**5. Continuity (Law of Perception)**\n- Group stimuli into forms following continuous lines/patterns\n- Example: Two overlapping lines rather than four lines meeting at center\n\n**6. Symmetry (Law of Perception)**\n- Symmetrical elements perceived as unified group\n- Example: Two overlapping diamonds instead of touching corner bricks\n\n---\n\n#### 3. **Depth Perception**\n\n**Definition**: Ability to see things 3-dimensionally and judge distance\n\n**Two Categories of Depth Cues**:\n\n### A. Non-Pictorial Cues (Physical functioning of eyes/brain)\n\n**1. Retinal Disparity (Binocular)**\n- Slight difference in images on each retina due to eye separation\n- Brain uses disparity to estimate depth\n- Most effective for objects within few meters\n\n**2. Convergence (Binocular)**\n- Inward rotation of eyes to focus on nearby object\n- Degree of convergence indicates distance\n- Angle of eye movement provides distance information\n\n### B. Pictorial Cues (Visual field features - all monocular)\n\n**1. Relative Size**\n- Farther objects appear smaller than similar closer objects\n\n**2. Interposition (Occlusion)**\n- Object partially blocking another perceived as closer\n- Blocked object perceived as farther\n\n**3. Linear Perspective**\n- Parallel lines (railroad tracks) converge with distance\n- Signals depth\n\n**4. Texture Gradient**\n- Textures appear denser and less detailed with distance\n\n**5. Light and Shadow**\n- Shadows indicate object shape and 3D position\n\n**6. Aerial Perspective**\n- Distant objects hazier/less vivid due to atmospheric scattering\n- Suggests greater distance\n\n**7. Relative Height**\n- Objects higher in visual field (near horizon) perceived as farther\n- Especially relevant in landscapes\n\n**Note**: Predator vs Prey eye placement\n- Predators: Forward-facing eyes for depth perception\n- Prey: Side-facing eyes for wide field of view\n\n---\n\n#### 4. **Perceptual Constancy**\n\n**Definition**: Ability to perceive object as unchanging despite changes in sensory information reaching eyes\n\n**Five Types**:\n\n**1. Size Constancy**\n- Brain perceives object's size as constant despite retinal image changes with distance\n- Example: Person appears same size at 5 or 50 feet away\n- **Ames Room (1946)**: Illusion where trapezoidal room tricks brain about size relationships\n\n**2. Shape Constancy**\n- Object's shape perceived as consistent from different angles\n- Example: Door appears rectangular whether viewed head-on or at angle (trapezoid on retina)\n\n**3. Brightness Constancy**\n- Objects perceived as having consistent brightness under different illumination\n- Example: White shirt appears equally white in sunlight or dim shade\n\n**4. Colour Constancy**\n- Object's color perceived as stable under different lighting\n- Example: Red apple looks red in sunlight or fluorescent light despite wavelength changes\n\n**5. Location Constancy**\n- Moving head produces changing retinal images\n- Don't perceive world as spinning\n- Due to kinaesthetic feedback\n\n---\n\n#### 5. **Visual Illusions**\n\n**Purpose**: Show how perception can be wrong; what we see isn't truthful reflection of reality\n**Key Insight**: Perception based on stimulus PLUS knowledge and experience\n\n**Major Illusions**:\n\n**1. Ponzo Illusion**\n- Top horizontal bar appears longer than bottom\n- Both actually same length\n- Context of converging lines affects perception\n\n**2. Horizontal-Vertical Illusion**\n- Vertical line appears longer than horizontal\n- Both equal length\n\n**3. Muller-Lyer Illusion**\n- Line with outgoing fins appears longer than line with ingoing fins\n- Actually same length\n- Classic depth perception misapplication\n\n**4. Poggendorf Illusion**\n- Diagonal line segments appear offset\n- Actually aligned\n\n**5. Titchener's Circles**\n- Central circle surrounded by large circles appears smaller\n- Central circle surrounded by small circles appears larger\n- Both central circles same size\n- Context affects size perception\n\n---\n\n#### 6. **Theories of Visual Perception**\n\n### A. Gestalt Theory\n- \"The whole is greater than the sum of its parts\"\n- Brain organizes sensory information into meaningful wholes\n- Covered in principles section above\n\n### B. Constructivist Theory (Gregory, 1966) - TOP-DOWN\n\n**Core Ideas**:\n- Perception is ACTIVE, constructive process\n- Brain uses: sensory input + prior knowledge + expectations\n- Driven by higher-level cognitive processes (memory, experience, context)\n- **Indirect perception**: Brain constructs interpretations\n\n**Key Characteristics**:\n- Top-down processing\n- Environment provides INCOMPLETE/AMBIGUOUS sensory input\n- Cognition is ESSENTIAL\n- Uses past experiences, expectations, inferences\n\n**Example**: Reading messy handwriting\n- Brain uses context and word knowledge to decipher unclear letters\n\n**Illusion Explanation**: Result from misapplied hypotheses or perceptual errors based on prior knowledge\n\n### C. Ecological Theory (Gibson, 1966) - BOTTOM-UP\n\n**Core Ideas**:\n- Perception is DIRECT, doesn't require complex cognitive processing\n- Environment provides ALL needed information through \"affordances\"\n- Emphasizes organism-environment interaction\n- Focuses on real-world, ecological contexts\n\n**Key Characteristics**:\n- Bottom-up processing\n- Optic array provides RICH, UNAMBIGUOUS information\n- Cognition is MINIMAL\n- Direct resonance with environment\n\n**Example**: Walking through forest\n- Perceive ground texture and slopes directly\n- Navigate without consciously analyzing each step\n\n**Illusion Explanation**: Occur due to insufficient/artificial environmental information (e.g., lab settings), not cognitive errors\n\n---\n\n### GREGORY vs GIBSON COMPARISON TABLE\n\n| Aspect | Gibson (Ecological/Direct) | Gregory (Constructivist/Indirect) |\n|--------|---------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| **Processing** | Bottom-up, direct | Top-down, indirect |\n| **Environment Role** | Central; provides rich, unambiguous info | Provides incomplete/ambiguous input |\n| **Cognition Role** | Minimal; direct resonance | Essential; active interpretation |\n| **Key Mechanism** | Affordances; optic array | Hypotheses; prior knowledge |\n| **Illusions** | Artificial/insufficient info | Misapplied hypotheses |\n\n---\n\n### COMPLEMENTARY VIEW (Harris, 1998)\n\n**Integration Perspective**:\n- Perception contributes in MANY different ways to everyday life\n- Some tasks more difficult than others\n- **Some accomplished directly** (as Gibson maintained)\n- **Others require sophisticated internal knowledge** (indirect approach)\n- NOT contradictory but complementary\n\n**Implication**: Both theories valid for different perceptual tasks and contexts\n\n---\n\n## KEY STUDIES & RESEARCHERS\n\n### Memory Topic:\n1. **George Miller (1956)** - Magic number 7±2 for STM capacity\n2. **Peterson & Peterson (1959)** - STM duration 15-30 seconds\n3. **Atkinson & Shiffrin (1968)** - Multi-Store Model\n4. **Murdock (1962)** - Serial Position Effect\n5. **Miller & Selfridge (1950)** - Semantic structure in STM\n6. **HM Case Study** - Anterograde amnesia, separate memory systems\n7. **Baddeley & Hitch (1974, 2000)** - Working Memory Model\n8. **Jenkins (1974)** - Incidental learning\n9. **Craik & Lockhart (1972)** - Levels of Processing Model\n10. **Craik & Tulving (1975)** - Depth of processing evidence\n11. **Schacter (2002)** - Efficient forgetting concept\n12. **Ebbinghaus (1885)** - Early memory retrieval studies\n13. **Standing (1973)** - Memory recognition studies\n\n### Perception Topic:\n1. **Ehrenfels (1890)** - Pattern quality greater than sum of parts\n2. **Macknik & Martinez-Conde (2014)** - Brain interpretation of reality\n3. **Ramachandran & Rogers-Ramachandran (2004)** - Size constancy\n4. **Ames (1946)** - Ames Room illusion\n5. **Gregory (1966)** - Constructivist theory\n6. **Gibson (1966)** - Ecological theory\n7. **Harris (1998)** - Complementary view of perception theories\n\n---\n\n## IMPORTANT EXAMPLES & APPLICATIONS\n\n### Memory Examples:\n1. **Chunking**: Hyphenated phone numbers easier to remember\n2. **Shopping List**: Comparing MSM vs WMM processing\n3. **Flashbulb Memories**: Celebrity deaths creating vivid memories\n4. **Procedural Memory**: Riding bicycle, brushing teeth\n5. **Proactive Interference**: Old phone number interfering with new\n6. **Retroactive Interference**: New language affecting old language recall\n7. **LOP Example**: \"Elephant\" - repetition vs semantic processing\n\n### Perception Examples:\n1. **Melody**: Individual notes vs recognizable tune (Gestalt)\n2. **Forest Navigation**: Direct perception of ground texture (Gibson)\n3. **Messy Handwriting**: Context-based interpretation (Gregory)\n4. **Ames Room**: Size constancy breakdown\n5. **Door Shape**: Shape constancy from different angles\n6. **White Shirt**: Brightness constancy in different lighting\n7. **Red Apple**: Color constancy under different lights\n\n---\n\n## SUMMARY OF TOPICS\n\n### Week 5 Part 1 - Memory:\n- Definition and three processes (encoding, storage, retrieval)\n- Three forms of storage (sensory, STM, LTM)\n- Multi-Store Model and supporting evidence\n- Three types of LTM (episodic, semantic, procedural)\n- Working Memory Model with four components\n- Levels of Processing challenging MSM\n- Three theories of forgetting (decay, displacement, interference)\n\n### Week 5 Part 2 / Week 6 - Perception:\n- Definition and relationship to reality\n- Six Gestalt principles (figure-ground, proximity, closure, similarity, continuity, symmetry)\n- Depth perception (binocular and monocular cues)\n- Five types of perceptual constancy\n- Five major visual illusions\n- Three theories (Gestalt, Constructivist, Ecological)\n- Complementary view integrating theories\n\n---\n\n## CONTENT STATISTICS\n\n**Memory Content**:\n- 7 major theoretical frameworks/models\n- 13 key researchers/studies\n- 11+ key concepts with definitions\n- 7+ practical examples\n\n**Perception Content**:\n- 6 Gestalt principles\n- 9 depth perception cues (2 binocular, 7 monocular)\n- 5 types of constancy\n- 5 major illusions\n- 3 theoretical approaches\n- 7+ key researchers\n\n**Total**: 20+ distinct concepts, 20+ researchers/studies, robust content for quiz generation\n\n---\n\n*Document created by content-analyst-week-132806-1938df*\n*Task: TASK-20260113-132732-7d7996c7*\n*Date: 2026-01-13*\n"}}],"stop_reason":"tool_use","stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1120,"cache_read_input_tokens":64660,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1120,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":5198,"service_tier":"standard"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"4802a52b-54ec-4df1-872f-3b112865c5fe","uuid":"76092b41-8758-4399-addc-f1a1f09c1cba"}
