## Key Concepts and Definitions

### I. Biological Approaches

#### 1. Psychopharmacology
- **Definition**: The study of how drugs affect cognitions, emotions, and behavior
- **Three major drug categories**: Antipsychotic, Antianxiety, Antidepressant

#### 2. Antipsychotic Drugs
- **Mechanism**: Decrease action of dopamine
- **Effects**: Reduce positive symptoms of schizophrenia (delusions, hallucinations)
- **Limitations**: Little effect on negative symptoms

#### 3. Antianxiety Drugs
- **Purpose**: Reduce anxiety without affecting alertness or concentration
- **Side effects**: Drowsiness, lethargy, concentration difficulties, dependence

#### 4. Antidepressant Drugs (Four Classes)
- **Tricyclics**: Increase activity of norepinephrine and serotonin
- **MAO inhibitors**: Increase NE and serotonin, but more severe side effects
- **SSRIs (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors)**: Increase serotonin activity, milder side effects, reduce symptoms more rapidly
- **SNRIs (Serotonin-Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors)**: Increase both serotonin and norepinephrine

#### 5. Criticisms of Drug Treatments
- Up to 90% of effects may be placebo effects
- Do not "cure" the disorder
- Do not teach coping and problem-solving skills
- High relapse rate

#### 6. Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT)
- **Procedure**: Patient given sedative and muscle relaxant, electrodes attached to scalp, brief shock (<1 second) causes CNS seizure
- **Uses**: Severe depression with high suicide risk
- **Benefits**: Effects can be immediate
- **Criticisms**:
  - High relapse possibility
  - Permanent memory loss possible
  - Permanent brain damage possible
  - Mechanism unknown

#### 7. Psychosurgery
- **Definition**: Surgical procedures that remove or destroy brain tissue to change disordered behavior
- **Use**: Rarely, as last resort only

### II. Psychodynamic Therapies

#### 8. Core Focus
- Internal conflicts and unconscious factors underlying maladaptive behavior
- **Goal**: Help clients achieve insight

#### 9. Insight
- **Definition**: The conscious awareness of the psychodynamics that underlie problems

#### 10. Psychodynamic Techniques

##### Free Association
- Clients verbally report without censorship any thoughts, feelings, or images
- Provides clues about important themes and issues

##### Dream Interpretation
- Dreams express unconscious dreams, fantasies, and wishes
- Analyst helps interpret symbolism in dreams

### III. Humanistic Psychotherapies

#### 11. Core Principles
- People capable of consciously controlling actions
- Take responsibility for own choices and behavior
- Everyone possesses inner resources for self-healing and personal growth
- Focus on present and future instead of past

#### 12. Person-Centered Therapy (Carl Rogers)
Three essential therapist attributes:

##### Unconditional Positive Regard
- Therapist genuinely cares about and accepts client
- Without judgment or evaluation

##### Empathy
- Willingness and ability to view world through client's eyes

##### Genuineness
- Consistency between therapist's feelings and behavior

### IV. Cognitive Therapies

#### 13. Core Focus
- Role of irrational and self-defeating thought patterns
- Help clients discover and change cognitions underlying problems
- Thought patterns are automatic and ingrained (not unconscious)

#### 14. Rational-Emotive Behavioral Therapy (REBT) - Albert Ellis
**ABCD Model**:
- **A (Activating event)**: Trigger that seems to cause the emotion
- **B (Belief system)**: How person appraises the event
- **C (Consequences)**: Emotional and behavioral consequences of appraisal
- **D (Disputing)**: Challenging erroneous belief systems

#### 15. Cognitive Therapy - Aaron Beck
- **Goal**: Identify faulty/negative automatic thoughts
- **Example**: "I am worthless and cannot do anything right" in depression
- **The Negative Triad**: Three-part negative thinking pattern
- **Core principle**: Thoughts (not situations) cause maladaptive emotional reactions

#### 16. Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT)
- **Definition**: Evidence-based talk therapy managing problems by changing thinking (cognitions) and behavior
- **Core concept**: Thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are interconnected
- **Process**:
  1. Identify and challenge unhelpful thoughts
  2. Replace with balanced and realistic ones
  3. Encourage healthier behavioral changes
- **Uses ABC model**

**CBT Example** (Social Anxiety at Party):
- **A (Activating)**: Arrive at party, no one approaches to chat
- **B (Belief)**: "They think I'm boring. Everyone dislikes me. I'm unlikeable."
- **C (Consequence)**:
  - Emotional: Intense anxiety, embarrassment, shame
  - Behavioral: Leave early, avoid eye contact, stand alone

### V. Behavior Therapies

#### 17. Core Beliefs
- Maladaptive behaviors are not merely symptoms—they ARE the problem
- Problem behaviors learned same way normal behaviors are
- Maladaptive behaviors can be unlearned through classical conditioning, operant conditioning, and modeling

#### 18. Exposure Therapy
- **Purpose**: Treat phobias through exposure to feared stimulus
- **Effectiveness**: Highly effective for reducing anxiety responses
- **Types**: Systematic desensitization and Flooding

#### 19. Aversion Therapy
- **Technique**: Pair attractive stimulus with noxious stimulus to condition aversion
- **Examples**: Alcohol treatment, pedophile treatment
- **Effectiveness**: More effective with comprehensive treatment program

#### 20. Token Economy
- **Definition**: System for strengthening desired behaviors through systematic positive reinforcement
- **Mechanism**: Tokens given for desirable behaviors, exchanged for tangible reinforcers
- **Effectiveness**: Very effective in wide variety of situations

## Important Examples and Studies

### Example 1: Clockwork Orange Reference
- Malcolm McDowell with eyes clamped open
- Forced to watch violence and sadism films
- Given emetic drug beforehand
- Result: Nausea and violence become associated (aversion therapy)

### Example 2: CBT Social Anxiety Scenario
- Work party invitation triggers social anxiety
- Negative beliefs about social acceptance
- Leads to anxiety and avoidance behaviors
- CBT addresses thought patterns causing anxiety

## Other Therapeutic Approaches Mentioned

## Content Structure Recommendations

### Key Takeaways (3-4 points)

3. Cognitive therapies (REBT, Beck's CT, CBT) focus on changing irrational thought patterns that cause emotional distress
4. Behavioral therapies treat maladaptive behaviors as the problem itself, using exposure, aversion, and token economy techniques

### Summary Statement
