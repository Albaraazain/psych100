## WEEK 7: SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY (Nov 17-23)

### Learning Outcomes
1. Understand attribution theories and how people explain behavior
2. Explain conformity and group influence mechanisms
3. Describe obedience to authority and key experiments

### Key Concepts & Definitions

#### 1. ATTRIBUTIONS

**Definition**: How people explain the causes of behavior (of others and own)

**Types of Attribution**:
- **Internal (Dispositional)**: Behavior explained by something inside the person (intelligence, personality)
- **External (Situational)**: Behavior explained by something outside the person (luck, task difficulty)

**Three Classic Attribution Theories**:

1. **Heider's Naive Scientist Theory (1958)**
   - People perceive behavior as being caused
   - People give causal attributions even to inanimate objects
   - People use rational processes to explain events
   - **Key Study**: Heider & Simmel (1944) - geometric figures perceived as having personalities and intentions

2. **Jones & Davis: Correspondence Inference Theory (1965)**
   - We use information about behavior and its effects to draw correspondent inferences
   - Key factors:
     - **Intention**: Were effects of behavior intended?
     - **Social Desirability**: Were effects socially desirable or undesirable?
   - More likely to attribute to disposition when behavior is intentional and socially undesirable

3. **Kelley's Covariation Theory (1967, 1973)**
   - We make judgments based on three dimensions:
     - **Consensus**: Do other people behave the same way? (high = others act similarly; low = others act differently)
     - **Distinctiveness**: Is behavior unique to this situation? (high = only in this situation; low = typical across situations)
     - **Consistency**: Does person always behave this way? (high = always; low = rarely)
   - Example: "Sarah fails her PSYC100 exam"
     - High distinctiveness = failed only this exam
     - High consistency = failed exams before
     - High consensus = other students also failed this exam

#### 2. ATTRIBUTION ERRORS AND BIASES

1. **Fundamental Attribution Error (Ross, 1977)**
   - Tendency to over-emphasize dispositional explanations for others' behavior
   - Under-emphasize situational influences
   - Default assumption: behavior reflects what "kind" of person they are
   - **Key Studies**:
     - **Quiz Game Study** (Ross, Amabile & Steinmetz, 1977): Questioners rated as more knowledgeable despite role advantage
     - **Castro Study** (Jones & Harris, 1967): Even when speech position determined by coin flip, speakers judged by content

2. **False Consensus Effect (Ross et al., 1977)**
   - Tendency to see own behavior as more typical than it actually is
   - Overestimate degree to which others agree
   - **Study**: Sign-wearing experiment - 50% agreed, but agreers thought 63% would agree; disagreers thought 77% would disagree

3. **Self-Serving Bias (Miller & Ross, 1975)**
   - Take credit for success (self-enhancing)
   - Deny responsibility for failure (self-protective)
   - Example: "I got 90 for my essay!" vs. "The lecturer gave me 40!"
   - Dispositional attributions for success, situational for failures

4. **Actor-Observer Effect (Jones & Nisbett, 1972)**
   - Attribute own behavior to situational factors
   - Attribute others' behavior to dispositional factors
   - Actors: "I couldn't help it; I was forced by events"
   - Observers: "He/she is bad tempered, careless, lazy"
   - **Study** (Nisbett et al., 1973): Asked about own major choice (situational) vs. friend's choice (dispositional)

#### 3. CONFORMITY AND GROUP INFLUENCE

**Definitions**:
- **Conformity**: Change in belief or behavior to fit in with a group
- **Internalization**: Changing real thoughts and feelings due to indirect pressure
- **Compliance**: Agreeing publicly but not changing internal opinions

**Key Studies**:

1. **Sherif's Autokinetic Effect Study (1935)**
   - **Phenomenon**: In darkness, stationary light appears to move
   - **Method**: Participants judged light movement alone, then in groups of 2-3
   - **Result**: Group norms emerged; individual judgments converged
   - **Explanation**: **Informational influence** - ambiguous situation, relied on others for information
   - Public response = private acceptance (internalization)

2. **Asch's Line Studies (1950s)**
   - **Task**: Judge which line matches standard (unambiguous)
   - **Control**: 35/37 correct (task was easy)
   - **Experimental**: 1 real participant + 6 confederates giving wrong answers
   - **Results**: 37% gave incorrect response, showed extreme discomfort
   - **Explanation**: **Normative influence** - fear of social disapproval
   - Public response ≠ private acceptance (compliance)

**Factors Affecting Conformity**:
- **Group size**: Conformity increases with group size
- **Presence of dissenter**: One person disagreeing greatly reduces conformity
- **Culture**: Greater in collectivistic cultures

**Two Types of Social Influence**:
- **Informational Social Influence** (Sherif):
  - Situation is ambiguous
  - Rely on others for information
  - Public response = private acceptance (internalization)
- **Normative Social Influence** (Asch):
  - Situation is clear
  - Looking for social approval
  - Public response ≠ private acceptance (compliance)

#### 4. OBEDIENCE TO AUTHORITY

**Definition**: Acting in response to direct order from authority figure; wouldn't have acted without order

**Milgram's Shock Generator Studies (1974)**:
- **Setup**: "Teacher" gives electric shocks to "learner" for wrong answers (shocks were fake)
- **Prediction**: Milgram's colleagues predicted only sadists would go to maximum voltage
- **Results**:
  - **65%** (26/40) administered maximum 450-volt shock
  - No one stopped before 300 volts (average 360 volts)
  - Many were uncomfortable but obeyed authority
- **Implications**: Ordinary people can commit harmful acts under authority pressure

**Other Obedience Studies**:

1. **Hofling et al. (1966) - Nurse Study**
   - Nurses asked to give potentially lethal injections
   - 21/22 prepared to do it despite guidelines forbidding it
   - High ecological validity (real-life setting)

2. **Sheridan & King (1972) - Puppy Study**
   - Participants gave real (small) electric shocks to puppy
   - Obeyed even seeing animal distress

3. **Zimbardo's Stanford Prison Experiment (1973)**
   - Demonstrates conformity, obedience, and power of social situations
   - Guards became authoritarian, enforced harsh rules (stripping, delousing, sleep deprivation)
   - Prisoners showed passive submission, anxiety, rebellion
   - Planned for 2 weeks, ended after 6 days due to ethical concerns over abuse and emotional breakdowns

## WEEK 8: DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY (Nov 24-30)

### Learning Outcomes
1. Early experiences and attachment
2. Development of self-concept
3. Cognitive development and Piaget's Theory
4. Zone of Proximal Development - Vygotsky

### Key Concepts & Definitions

#### 1. ATTACHMENT

**Definition** (Kagan et al., 1978): Intense emotional relationship specific to two people, endures over time, prolonged separation accompanied by stress and sorrow

**Key Principle**: First attachment acts as prototype for all later relationships

**Harlow's Monkey Experiments (1950s-60s)**:
- **Question**: Is attachment based on biological needs (feeding) or emotional comfort?
- **Setup**: Baby monkeys with two surrogate mothers:
  - Wire mother: provided milk
  - Cloth mother: no milk, but soft terry cloth
- **Results**: Monkeys overwhelmingly preferred cloth mother
  - Only went to wire mother briefly to feed
  - Immediately returned to cloth mother for comfort
- **Follow-up Studies**:
  - Total isolation: Severe emotional disturbance, socially withdrawn, self-harming
  - Partial isolation (could see/hear but not touch): Still developed abnormal behaviors
- **Conclusions**:
  - Attachment is not just about feeding—it's about security, comfort, and love
  - Touch and emotional warmth essential for healthy development
  - Lack of attachment leads to severe long-term emotional damage

**John Bowlby's Attachment Theory (1950s-60s)**:
- First to propose attachment as **innate biological system** that evolved for survival
- Children born with instinct to seek closeness when threatened, frightened, or ill
- Caregiver provides:
  - **Secure base**: for exploring the world
  - **Safe haven**: for comfort
- **Critical period**: Birth to about 3 years
- Bowlby believed in **monotropy**: one primary attachment (usually mother) is unique and strongest
- "Mother love in infancy is as important for mental health as vitamins and proteins for physical health" (1951)
- Note: Schaffer & Emerson showed multiple attachments are normal (fathers important too!)

**Mary Ainsworth's Strange Situation (1970s)**:
- **Method**: Observed infants (12-18 months) in 8-step procedure with separations and reunions
- **Procedure**:
  1. Parent + baby enter room
  2. Baby explores with parent nearby
  3. Stranger enters
  4. Parent leaves (separation anxiety)
  5. Parent returns (reunion reaction)
  6. Baby alone (separation distress)
  7. Stranger re-enters
  8. Parent returns (second reunion)

**Four Attachment Styles**:

| Style | % of Infants | Child Behavior | Later Adult Traits |
|-------|--------------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Secure** | ~65% | Distressed when caregiver leaves, comforted when returns; uses caregiver as secure base | Trusting, emotionally stable, comfortable with intimacy |
| **Insecure-Avoidant** | ~20% | Little distress when caregiver leaves; avoids/ignores caregiver upon return | Emotionally distant, values independence, avoids closeness |
| **Insecure-Resistant (Ambivalent)** | ~10-15% | Clings to caregiver, little exploration; highly distressed when leaves; seeks comfort but resists it upon return | Clingy, overly dependent, fears abandonment |
| **Disorganized** | ~5-10% | Contradictory/confused behavior (approaching but looking away); often linked to trauma/neglect | Fearful of intimacy, trauma-related patterns |

**Effects of Deprivation and Privation - Are They Reversible?**

YES! Evidence from case studies:

1. **Czech Twins (Andreas and Petr, discovered 1972, age ~7)**
   - Locked in cellar/unheated room with almost no contact until age 7
   - At discovery: almost no speech, IQ ~40, autistic-like behaviors, no social attachment
   - **Outcome**: Dramatic recovery with intensive rehabilitation
   - By adolescence: IQs rose to 90-100, normal language and social relationships, finished school, lived normal adult lives

2. **Romanian Orphanages (Rutter, Kreppner, 1990s)**
   - After 1989 fall of Ceaușescu: thousands of children in extreme deprivation
   - Almost no caregiver interaction (1:30-1:60 ratios), minimal language, severe malnutrition
   - **Findings**: Clear sensitive period
     - Deprivation lasting beyond ~6 months: markedly increased risk
     - Beyond 24 months: very high risk
   - Recovery possible but depends on timing

**ACE and Attachment**:
- Attachment theory and Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) are deeply interconnected
- Both highlight profound long-term impact of early life experiences on physical and mental well-being and relationships throughout life

#### 2. THE SELF-CONCEPT

**Definition**: Individual's overall self-awareness; "the self is the individual as known to the individual" (Murphy, 1947)

**Three Components**:
1. **Self-image**: WHO AM I?
2. **Self-esteem**: HOW I FEEL ABOUT MYSELF?
3. **Ideal-self**: WHO I WANT TO BE?

**Developmental Changes in Self-Concept**:

**First Few Months**:
- Baby gradually distinguishes itself from environment and others
- According to Maccoby (1980), babies distinguish on two counts:
  1. Own fingers hurt when bitten (not when biting rattle or mother's fingers)
  2. Associate feelings from own body movements with sight of own limbs and sounds of own cries

**Gallup's Mirror Test (1977)**:
- Original studies with chimpanzees using mirror and marking
- Tested self-recognition

**Lewis & Brooks-Gunn (1979) - Rouge Test with Children**:
- **Method**: Mother applies red dot to child's nose (while pretending to wipe face)
- Observe how often child touches nose before and after seeing mirror
- **Results**:
  - Before 15 months: Never touched dot
  - 15-18 months: 5-25% touched dot
  - 18-24 months: **75%** touched dot
- **Interpretation**: Self-recognition emerges between 15-24 months

#### 3. COGNITIVE DEVELOPMENT - PIAGET'S THEORY

**Core Principles**:
1. Cognitive development occurs through interaction of innate capacities with environmental events
2. Progresses through hierarchical, qualitatively different stages
3. All children pass through stages in same sequence without skipping
4. Stages are universal (same across cultures)
5. Functional invariants: fundamental aspects that remain constant
6. Principal cognitive structure that changes: **schema** (mental categories)

**Functional Invariants**:

1. **Assimilation**: Taking in new information and fitting it into existing schemas without changing them
   - Example: Child knows dogs are furry, four-legged, bark. Sees cat, calls it "dog" because it fits existing "dog" schema

2. **Accommodation**: Modifying existing schemas or creating new ones when information doesn't fit
   - Example: After being corrected that cat is not dog, child learns cats meow and have different behaviors. Creates new "cat" schema separate from "dog"

**Four Stages of Cognitive Development**:

**1. Sensorimotor Stage (0-2 years)**
- Understand world through sensory experiences and physical interactions
- **Key Achievement**: **Object Permanence**
  - Understanding that objects continue to exist when not seen
  - Piaget claimed infants younger than 9 months don't have mental representation of objects

**2. Pre-operational Stage (2-7 years)**
- World represented symbolically through words and mental images
- No understanding of basic mental operations or rules
- **Limitations**:
  1. **No Conservation**: Don't understand basic properties stay same despite appearance changes
     - Example: Water in differently shaped glasses looks like different amounts
  2. **Egocentrism**: Difficulty viewing world from another's perspective
     - Example: Three mountains task
  3. **Irreversibility**: Cannot mentally reverse actions
     - Example: Cannot understand pouring water back makes it look the same
  4. **Animism**: Belief that inanimate objects have lifelike qualities
     - Example: "The sidewalk was mad and made me fall down"

**3. Concrete Operational Stage (7-11 years)**
- Capable of performing logical operations, but only with actual objects present
- Can conserve, show reversibility, more logical classification
- Less egocentric
- **Remaining limitation**: **Transitivity tasks** difficult without concrete objects
  - Example: "Alan is taller than Nigel, Nigel is taller than Charlie—who is taller, Alan or Charlie?"
  - Cannot solve entirely in heads; need dolls or concrete objects

**4. Formal Operational Stage (11+ years)**
- Think logically and systematically about both concrete and abstract problems
- Form hypotheses and test them thoughtfully
- Can handle abstract reasoning without concrete props

#### 4. VYGOTSKY'S ALTERNATIVE MODEL

**Key Difference from Piaget**:
- Piaget: Child as individual scientist discovering world
- Vygotsky: Child as participant in **interactive process**
- Socially and culturally determined knowledge gradually becomes individualized

**Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD)**:
- Gap between what learner can do alone and what they can do with help
- Learning occurs in this zone with guidance from more knowledgeable other

**Scaffolding**:
- Help provided by more knowledgeable other within the ZPD
- Temporary support gradually removed as learner becomes more competent
