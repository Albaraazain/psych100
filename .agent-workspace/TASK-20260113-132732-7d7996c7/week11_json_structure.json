  "title": "Treatments and Therapies",
  "subtitle": "General Psychology - PSYC100",

  "summary": "Week 11 examines the major therapeutic approaches in psychology, including biological treatments (medications, ECT, psychosurgery), psychodynamic therapies focused on unconscious conflicts and insight, humanistic approaches emphasizing client growth and self-healing, cognitive therapies targeting irrational thought patterns, and behavioral therapies addressing learned maladaptive behaviors through conditioning principles.",

  "keyTakeaways": [
    "Five major treatment approaches exist: Biological, Psychodynamic, Humanistic, Cognitive, and Behavioral, each with distinct theoretical foundations and techniques.",
    "Biological treatments include three drug categories (antipsychotics, antianxiety, antidepressants with 4 classes), ECT for severe depression, and psychosurgery as last resort, though criticized for high relapse rates and not teaching coping skills.",
    "Cognitive therapies (REBT, Beck's CT, CBT) focus on identifying and changing irrational thought patterns that cause emotional distress, using models like ABCD and addressing automatic negative thoughts.",
    "Behavioral therapies view maladaptive behaviors as the problem itself (not symptoms), using exposure therapy, aversion therapy, and token economy systems based on classical and operant conditioning principles."
  ],

  "learning_outcomes": [
    "Understand biological treatments including psychopharmacology (antipsychotic, antianxiety, and antidepressant drugs), electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), and psychosurgery",
    "Explain psychodynamic therapies focusing on unconscious conflicts, insight, free association, and dream interpretation",
    "Describe humanistic psychotherapies, particularly Carl Rogers' person-centered therapy with unconditional positive regard, empathy, and genuineness",
    "Analyze cognitive therapies including Rational-Emotive Behavioral Therapy (REBT), Beck's Cognitive Therapy, and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)",
    "Examine behavioral therapies including exposure therapy, aversion therapy, and token economy systems"
