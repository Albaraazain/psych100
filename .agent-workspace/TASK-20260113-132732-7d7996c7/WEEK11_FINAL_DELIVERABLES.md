## DELIVERABLE 2: Key Concepts, Definitions, and Theories (18 items)

### BIOLOGICAL TREATMENTS (6 concepts)

1. **Psychopharmacology** - Study of how drugs affect cognitions, emotions, and behavior
2. **Antipsychotic Drugs** - Decrease dopamine; reduce positive schizophrenia symptoms
3. **Antianxiety Drugs** - Reduce anxiety but cause drowsiness, lethargy, dependence
4. **SSRIs** - Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors; milder side effects, faster action
5. **Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT)** - Brief shock causing seizure; for severe depression
6. **Psychosurgery** - Surgical removal/destruction of brain tissue; last resort only

**Drug Classification**:
- Antipsychotics (dopamine blockers)
- Antianxiety (reduce anxiety)
- Antidepressants: 4 classes
  - Tricyclics (increase NE and serotonin)
  - MAO inhibitors (increase NE and serotonin, severe side effects)
  - SSRIs (increase serotonin, milder effects)
  - SNRIs (increase serotonin and NE)

**Criticisms**: 90% may be placebo effects, don't cure disorders, don't teach coping skills, high relapse rate

### PSYCHODYNAMIC THERAPIES (3 concepts)

7. **Insight** - Conscious awareness of psychodynamics underlying problems (therapy goal)
8. **Free Association** - Verbalize uncensored thoughts/feelings/images; reveals themes
9. **Dream Interpretation** - Analyze dream symbolism expressing unconscious wishes

**Focus**: Internal conflicts and unconscious factors underlying maladaptive behavior

### HUMANISTIC THERAPIES (3 concepts)

10. **Unconditional Positive Regard** - Genuine care/acceptance without judgment
11. **Empathy** - View world through client's eyes
12. **Genuineness** - Consistency between therapist's feelings and behavior

**Carl Rogers' Person-Centered Therapy**: Three essential therapist attributes above

**Philosophy**:
- People capable of conscious control
- Everyone has inner resources for self-healing
- Focus on present/future (not past)

### COGNITIVE THERAPIES (3 concepts)

13. **ABCD Model (Ellis)** - Rational-Emotive Behavioral Therapy framework
    - A = Activating event
    - B = Belief system
    - C = Consequences (emotional/behavioral)
    - D = Disputing erroneous beliefs

14. **Negative Triad (Beck)** - Three-part negative thinking pattern in depression

15. **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)** - Interconnected thoughts/feelings/behaviors
    - Identify unhelpful thoughts
    - Replace with balanced ones
    - Encourage healthier behaviors

**Core Principle**: Thoughts (not situations) cause maladaptive emotions

### BEHAVIORAL THERAPIES (3 concepts)

16. **Exposure Therapy** - Treat phobias through exposure (desensitization/flooding)
17. **Aversion Therapy** - Pair attractive stimulus with noxious stimulus
18. **Token Economy** - Positive reinforcement system with exchangeable tokens

**Core Belief**: Maladaptive behaviors ARE the problem (not symptoms)

**Learning Mechanisms**: Classical conditioning, operant conditioning, modeling

---

## DELIVERABLE 3: Learning Objectives (5 items)

1. **Understand biological treatments** including psychopharmacology (antipsychotic, antianxiety, and antidepressant drugs), electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), and psychosurgery

2. **Explain psychodynamic therapies** focusing on unconscious conflicts, insight, free association, and dream interpretation

3. **Describe humanistic psychotherapies**, particularly Carl Rogers' person-centered therapy with unconditional positive regard, empathy, and genuineness

4. **Analyze cognitive therapies** including Rational-Emotive Behavioral Therapy (REBT), Beck's Cognitive Therapy, and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)

5. **Examine behavioral therapies** including exposure therapy, aversion therapy, and token economy systems

---

## DELIVERABLE 4: Important Examples, Studies, and Applications

### Example 1: Clockwork Orange (Aversion Therapy)
- **Context**: Film depicting aversion therapy
- **Procedure**: Character's eyes clamped open, forced to watch violence
- **Conditioning**: Given emetic drug beforehand
- **Result**: Nausea becomes associated with violence
- **Application**: Demonstrates classical conditioning in aversion therapy

### Example 2: CBT Social Anxiety at Party
- **A (Activating Event)**: Arrive at party, no one approaches to chat
- **B (Belief)**: "They think I'm boring and awkward. Everyone dislikes me. I'm unlikeable."
- **C (Consequences)**:
  - Emotional: Intense anxiety, embarrassment, shame
  - Behavioral: Leave party early, avoid eye contact, stand alone in corner
- **Application**: Shows how beliefs (not events) create emotional distress

### Example 3: Harlow Relevance to Therapy
- **Connection**: Demonstrates importance of comfort and attachment
- **Application**: Informs humanistic approach about emotional needs

### Additional Therapeutic Modalities Mentioned
- EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing)
- ACT (Acceptance and Commitment Therapy)
- Schema Therapy
- DBT (Dialectical Behavior Therapy)
- Gestalt Therapy
- Existential Therapy
- Attachment-based Therapy
- Couples, Sex, and Family Therapy

## DELIVERABLE 5: Structured Summary Document

### Location
Two comprehensive documents created in workspace:
1. `week11_treatments_therapies_analysis.md` - Detailed analysis (20 pages)
2. `week11_json_structure.json` - JSON-ready structure with all components
3. `WEEK11_FINAL_DELIVERABLES.md` - This summary document

### Content Structure

**Week Identification**:
- Week 11
- Date Range: December 29 - January 4
- Topic: Treatments and Therapies

**Summary Statement**:
Week 11 examines the major therapeutic approaches in psychology, including biological treatments (medications, ECT, psychosurgery), psychodynamic therapies focused on unconscious conflicts and insight, humanistic approaches emphasizing client growth and self-healing, cognitive therapies targeting irrational thought patterns, and behavioral therapies addressing learned maladaptive behaviors through conditioning principles.

**Key Takeaways** (4 points):
1. Five major treatment approaches exist: Biological, Psychodynamic, Humanistic, Cognitive, and Behavioral, each with distinct theoretical foundations and techniques
2. Biological treatments include three drug categories (antipsychotics, antianxiety, antidepressants with 4 classes), ECT for severe depression, and psychosurgery as last resort, though criticized for high relapse rates and not teaching coping skills
3. Cognitive therapies (REBT, Beck's CT, CBT) focus on identifying and changing irrational thought patterns that cause emotional distress, using models like ABCD and addressing automatic negative thoughts
4. Behavioral therapies view maladaptive behaviors as the problem itself (not symptoms), using exposure therapy, aversion therapy, and token economy systems based on classical and operant conditioning principles
