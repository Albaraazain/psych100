## WEEK 9: INTELLIGENCE (Dec 1 - Dec 7)

### Learning Outcomes
1. Defining intelligence
2. Four major theories of intelligence (Spearman, Cattell, Sternberg, Gardner)
3. Intelligence testing methods (Stanford-Binet, Wechsler, Raven's)
4. Gender and racial differences in IQ
5. The Flynn Effect

### Definition of Intelligence
**Standard Definition:** "A very general mental capability that involves the ability to reason, plan, solve problems, think abstractly, comprehend complex ideas, learn quickly, and learn from experience."

---

## Key Concepts & Theories

### 1. Spearman's Two-Factor Theory (1904)
- **Core Concept:** All intellectual activities share a common underlying factor
- **Components:**
  - **General Intelligence (g):** Single general intelligence influencing performance on every cognitive task
  - **Specific Abilities (s):** Many specific abilities unique to each task
- **Summary:** Performance on any mental task depends on how intelligent you are overall (g) plus how skilled you are in that specific area (s)

### 2. Cattell's Fluid and Crystallized Intelligence Theory (gf-gc theory, 1963)
- **Core Concept:** General intelligence (g) can be subdivided into two major dimensions
- **Components:**
  - **Fluid Intelligence (gf):** The ability to reason, think abstractly, and solve novel problems—independent of prior knowledge or experience
  - **Crystallized Intelligence (gc):** The ability to use learned knowledge, skills, and experience. Grows through education and cultural exposure

### 3. Sternberg's Triarchic Theory
- **Three types of intelligences** (specific types not detailed in lecture)

### 4. Gardner's Multiple Intelligences Theory
- **Eight types of intelligences** (specific types not detailed in lecture)

---

## Intelligence Testing

### Stanford-Binet Test
- **Origin:** Simon-Binet test (1905) - first INDIVIDUAL intelligence test
  - Commissioned by French government to identify children who wouldn't benefit from ordinary schooling
- **History:** Revisions led to Stanford-Binet test
  - 4th revision (1986)
  - 5th edition (2003) - current version
- **Structure:**
  - Verbal and nonverbal scales are balanced (based on gf-gc theory)
  - Mean = 100, SD = 15
  - Provides: Verbal IQ, Nonverbal IQ, Full-Scale IQ

### Army Alpha and Army Beta Tests (Historical)
- **Historical Significance:** Very first GROUP intelligence tests in history
- **Period:** Developed 1917-1919 by U.S. Army during World War I
- **Purpose:** Screen and classify over 1.7 million recruits
- **Types:**
  - **Army Alpha:** Designed for literate recruits (could read and write English well)
  - **Army Beta:** Designed for illiterate recruits or non-English speakers (mostly recent immigrants from Southern/Eastern Europe and some African Americans)

### Wechsler Tests
- **Status:** The most commonly used IQ tests globally
- **Structure:** Balanced verbal and nonverbal scales
- **Most Recent Versions:**
  - **WPPSI-IV (2012):** Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence - ages 2.5-6 years
  - **WISC-V (2014):** Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children - ages 6-16 years
  - **WAIS-V (2024):** Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale - ages 16-90 years

### Raven's Progressive Matrices
- **Versions:**
  - Standard Progressive Matrices (SPM)
  - Advanced Progressive Matrices (APM)
  - Colored Progressive Matrices (CPM for children)
- **Developer:** Raven (1938; 1998)
- **Key Features:**
  - Non-verbal
  - Culture-reduced

---

## Gender Differences in IQ

### Construction Bias
- Most IQ tests have been constructed so that there are no differences in scores between genders
- Any difference between genders may only have been negligible (Terman, 1916)
- Meta-analyses reporting scores for men average 5 IQ points more than women (Irwing & Lynn, 2005) have small effect sizes

### Male Advantages
1. **Visuo-spatial tasks** (e.g., mental rotation)
   - Mean of male distribution on mental rotation is almost one standard deviation above that for females (Masters and Sanders, 1993)
   - Applications: Constructing models, furniture assembly
2. **Mechanical reasoning** (e.g., maintaining, repairing, operating equipment)
3. **Quantitative tasks** (mathematics)

### Female Advantages
1. **Verbal tasks:** Synonym generation and verbal fluency
   - Mean of female distribution is between 0.5 and 1.2 standard deviations above that of males
2. **Memory tasks:** Females may perform better than males on some memory tasks

### Explanations for Gender Differences

#### Biological Factors
- **Brain size:** Males have ~10% larger brains on average, correlating with ~0.3-0.4 IQ points per gram (though females have higher neuronal density)
- **Hormones:**
  - Prenatal testosterone exposure predicts better spatial skills and male-typical play
  - Estrogen supports verbal memory
- **Evolution:** Hunter-gatherer hypothesis
  - Male spatial edges from navigation/hunting
  - Female verbal from social/child-rearing roles
  - Supported by cross-cultural consistency

#### Environmental Factors
- **Socialization:** Girls encouraged in language arts, boys in STEM toys (e.g., LEGO studies show early gaps)
- **Education:** Gaps narrow in gender-equal societies (e.g., PISA data from Nordic countries), but high-end math differences persist
- **Gender differentiated toys**

---

## Racial Differences in IQ

### Controversial Historical Claims
- **Jensen (1969):** Suggested white children were more intelligent than black children, and Asian children were more intelligent than either. Claimed differences were largely due to genetic factors
- **Herrnstein and Murray (1994):** The Bell Curve
  - Suggested a difference of one standard deviation between mean IQ scores of Blacks (mean = 85) and Whites (mean = 100) in USA
  - Suggested the differences are genetic in origin

### American Psychological Association Response
- **Action:** Assembled a task force to investigate Herrnstein and Murray's findings (Neisser et al., 1996)
- **Findings:** Task force agreed that there were differences between average IQ scores of African Americans and white Americans, but suggest that differences may be due to cultural factors

### Three Possible Explanations

#### 1. Test Bias
- IQ tests are not neutral but reflect the cultural knowledge, language, and experiences of the dominant group (typically White, middle-class Americans)
- Disadvantages minority groups
- Differences in scores do not measure true intelligence but familiarity with test content

#### 2. Genetics (Rejected by Scientific Consensus)
- This view argues that racial groups have evolved genetic differences in cognitive abilities due to historical selection pressures
- **Scientific Refutation:**
  - Race is primarily a social construct, not a biological one
  - No genes for "intelligence" have been identified that differ systematically by race
  - Source: Nisbett, R. E., et al. (2012). "Intelligence: New findings and theoretical developments." American Psychologist, 67(6), 503-504

#### 3. Environment (Consensus View)
- Attributes gaps to unequal access to resources, education, health, and opportunity, which shape cognitive development from prenatal stages onward
- Racial categories proxy for systemic inequities (e.g., racism, poverty)
- **Scientific Consensus:** The overwhelming scientific consensus is that environmental factors, compounded by historical and ongoing inequities, account for nearly all racial IQ differences

---

## The Flynn Effect

### Core Finding
- **Rate:** IQ has increased over time, on average around 3 IQ points per decade
- **Type of Gains:** Largest gains in fluid intelligence (reasoning, pattern recognition—e.g., Raven's Matrices), NOT crystallized (vocabulary, facts)
- **Geographic Scope:** Observed in 30+ countries, including developing nations
- **Recent Trend:** Slowing or reversing in some developed nations (Norway, Denmark, UK) since the late 1990s

### Explanations for Flynn Effect
1. **Nutrition:** Better prenatal and childhood nutrition → brain growth
2. **Education:** Longer schooling, abstract thinking training
3. **Cognitive Stimulation:** TV, puzzles, video games, VR
4. **Smaller families:** More parental attention per child
5. **Test familiarity:** Practice with multiple-choice, abstract problems

---

## Heredity vs. Environment

### Key Points
- Both heredity and environment contribute to intelligence
- Heredity and environment interact in various ways
- As people's genetic similarity increases, generally so does the similarity of their environments

### Research Evidence
- **Twin Studies:** Comparing IQs of Monozygotic twins reared apart (MZsRA) with Dizygotic twins
  - MZsRA are still more similar than same-sex Dizygotics reared together, suggesting a strong genetic influence
  - **Critique:** Studies of MZsRA have been criticized on several important methodological grounds
- **Adoption Studies:** Provide further support for genetic influence
  - **Environmental Impact:** When children from disadvantaged parents are adopted into high SES families, substantial gains in IQ can occur

---

## Important Applications & Examples
1. First individual IQ test: Simon-Binet test (1905)
2. First group IQ tests: Army Alpha/Beta (WWI, 1917-1919)
3. Most widely used IQ tests: Wechsler series (WPPSI, WISC, WAIS)
4. Culture-reduced testing: Raven's Progressive Matrices

---

## What is Abnormality?

### Seven Definitions

#### 1. Abnormality as Deviation from the (Statistical) Average
- Rarity/infrequency
- **Problem:** Gifted individuals are statistically rare, but not considered abnormal
- **Problem:** Common things like anxiety are considered as disorders

#### 2. Abnormality as Deviation from the Norm
- Society's norms and rule-breaking
- **Problem:** Is rule breaking bad? Is having a panic attack also bad?

#### 3. Abnormality as Deviation from Ideal Mental Health
- **Problem:** Varies across cultures

#### 4. Abnormality as Personal Distress
- Subjective suffering
- **Example:** Obsessive-compulsive behavior

#### 5. Abnormality as Others' Stress
- Interpersonal aspect
- **Example:** Narcissistic personality disorder

#### 6. Abnormality as Maladaptiveness
- Impaired functioning
- **Example:** Substance use

#### 7. Abnormality as Unexpected Behavior
- Out of proportion responses
- **Example:** Anxiety in anxiety disorders is out of proportion

**Key Insight:** Multiple perspectives are needed - no single definition is sufficient

---
