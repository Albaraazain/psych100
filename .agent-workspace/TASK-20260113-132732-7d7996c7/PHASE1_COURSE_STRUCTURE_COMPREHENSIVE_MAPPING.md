### Week 4: Motivation (Oct 20 - Oct 26)
**Date Range**: 20 October - 26 October
**PDF Source**: `PSYC100 GENERAL PSYCHOLOGY MOTIVATION.pdf/txt`

**Learning Outcomes**:
1. What is motivation?
2. Drive theory
3. Instinct theory
4. Arousal theory
5. Expectancy-value theory
6. Intrinsic vs extrinsic motivation
7. Achievement motivation

**Key Theories**:

1. **Drive Theory (Clark Hull, 1943)**
   - Based on homeostasis
   - Physiological disruptions create drives (internal tensions)
   - Behavior motivated to reduce tension
   - Example: Hunger, thirst
   - Criticism: Doesn't explain dieting, eating when not hungry

2. **Instinct Theory**
   - Automatic, involuntary, unlearned patterns
   - Examples: Crying (babies), coughing, blinking
   - Buss (1999): Desire to pass on genes
   - Criticisms: Ignores learning/environment, doesn't account for individual differences

3. **Arousal Theory**
   - People seek optimal level of arousal
   - Low arousal → seek stimulation (watch exciting movie, exercise)
   - High arousal → seek relaxation (meditate, read)
   - Individual differences in optimal arousal
   - Criticism: Neglects emotional/social motivators

4. **Expectancy-Value Theory**
   - Motivation = expectancy × incentive value
   - Example: Student studies hard because expects success (high expectancy) and values good grade (high value)
   - Criticisms: Subjective, overemphasis on rationality, cultural variability

5. **Intrinsic vs Extrinsic Motivation**
   - Intrinsic: Activity for its own sake (enjoyment, challenge)
   - Extrinsic: Activity for external reward or avoiding punishment
   - Criticisms: Oversimplification, individual differences, contextual factors

6. **Achievement Motivation (McClelland & Atkinson, 1953)**
   - Need for achievement
   - Motive for success vs fear of failure
   - Measured through TAT (Thematic Apperception Test)
   - Criticisms: Subjective scoring, may not align with explicit behaviors

### Week 5: Perception (Nov 3 - Nov 9)
**Date Range**: 3 November - 9 November (Part 1 of 2-week block)
**PDF Source**: `PSYC100 GENERAL PSYCHOLOGY PERCEPTION.pdf/txt`

**Learning Outcomes**:
1. What is perception?
2. Gestalt Psychology principles
3. Depth perception (binocular and monocular cues)
4. Perceptual constancy
5. Visual illusions
6. Theories of visual perception (Gregory vs Gibson)

**Key Concepts**:

**Perception Definition**: The organization and interpretation of incoming sensory information to form inner representations of the external world

**Gestalt Principles**:
1. Figure-ground separation
2. Proximity (elements close together perceived as group)
3. Closure (complete incomplete forms)
4. Similarity (similar parts belong together)
5. Continuity (follow continuous lines/patterns)
6. Symmetry (symmetrical elements unified)

**Depth Perception Cues**:

*Non-Pictorial (Binocular) Cues*:
- Retinal disparity: Slight difference in images between two eyes
- Convergence: Inward rotation of eyes for nearby objects

*Pictorial (Monocular) Cues*:
1. Relative size (farther objects appear smaller)
2. Interposition/Occlusion (blocked object farther away)
3. Linear perspective (parallel lines converge)
4. Texture gradient (textures denser at distance)
5. Light and shadow
6. Aerial perspective (distant objects hazier)
7. Relative height (higher in visual field = farther)

**Perceptual Constancy**:
- Size constancy (object size constant despite distance)
- Shape constancy (shape constant despite viewing angle)
- Brightness constancy (brightness constant despite illumination)
- Color constancy (color stable under different lighting)
- Location constancy (world doesn't spin when we move)

**Visual Illusions**:
- Ponzo illusion, Horizontal-Vertical illusion, Muller-Lyer illusion, Poggendorf illusion, Titchener's circles, Ames room

**Theories**:
- **Gregory's Constructivist Theory**: Perception is indirect, top-down, uses prior knowledge and hypotheses
- **Gibson's Ecological Theory**: Perception is direct, bottom-up, picks up invariant information from environment (affordances)

### Week 6: Memory (Nov 3 - Nov 9)
**Date Range**: 3 November - 9 November (Part 2 of 2-week block)
**PDF Source**: `PSYC100 GENERAL PSYCHOLOGY MEMORY.pdf/txt`

**Learning Outcomes**:
1. What is memory?
2. Encoding, storage, and retrieval processes
3. Multi-Store Model (MSM) - Atkinson & Shiffrin
4. Types of long-term memory (episodic, semantic, procedural)
5. Working Memory Model (WMM) - Baddeley & Hitch
6. Levels of Processing Model (LOP) - Craik & Lockhart
7. Theories of forgetting

**Key Concepts**:

**Three Memory Processes**:
1. **Registration/Encoding**: Transformation of sensory input into storable form
   - Acoustic encoding (sound)
   - Visual encoding (images)
   - Semantic encoding (meaning)

2. **Storage**: Retaining information over time
   - Sensory memory (<1 second)
   - Short-term memory (15-30 seconds, 7±2 items capacity, acoustic coding)
   - Long-term memory (unlimited capacity/duration, semantic coding)

3. **Retrieval**: Recovering stored information when needed

**Multi-Store Model (Atkinson & Shiffrin, 1968)**:
- Three separate stores: Sensory register → STM → LTM
- Transfer through rehearsal
- Evidence: Serial position effect (primacy/recency), brain damage studies (HM case)

**Types of Long-Term Memory**:
1. **Episodic**: Personal experiences tied to time/place (autobiographical, flashbulb memories)
2. **Semantic**: General knowledge, facts, concepts (not tied to personal context)
3. **Procedural**: Skills, habits, motor routines (implicit, expressed through performance)

**Working Memory Model (Baddeley & Hitch, 1974/2000)**:
- Central executive: Manages attention, coordinates subsystems
- Phonological loop: Stores spoken words, allows rehearsal
- Visuo-spatial sketchpad: Holds and manipulates images
- Episodic buffer: Integrates information into episodes

**Levels of Processing (Craik & Lockhart, 1972)**:
- Depth of processing determines retention
- Shallow processing: Structural (appearance), phonemic (sound)
- Deep processing: Semantic (meaning) → better retention
- Evidence: Craik & Tulving (1975) - semantic questions produce better recall

**Theories of Forgetting**:
1. **Decay theory**: Memories fade over time without access/rehearsal
2. **Displacement theory**: New information pushes out old in STM
3. **Interference theory**:
   - Proactive interference (old interferes with new)
   - Retroactive interference (new interferes with old)

**Special Topic**: Efficient forgetting - Hyperthymestic syndrome (HSAM) shows importance of normal forgetting for functioning memory

### Week 8: Social Psychology (Nov 17 - Nov 23)
**Date Range**: 17 November - 23 November
**PDF Source**: `PSYC100 GENERAL PSYCHOLOGY SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY.pdf/txt`

**Learning Outcomes**:
1. Attribution theories (Naive scientist, Correspondence inference, Covariation)
2. Attribution errors and biases
3. Conformity and group influence
4. Obedience to authority

**Key Topics**:

**I. Attributions** (Explaining causes of behavior)

*Three Classic Theories*:
1. **Heider's Naive Scientist Theory (1958)**
   - People perceive behavior as caused
   - Give causal attributions even to inanimate objects
   - Heider & Simmel (1944): Geometric figures perceived as having personalities

2. **Jones & Davis: Correspondence Inference Theory (1965)**
   - Draw correspondent inferences from behavior to disposition
   - Factors: Intentionality, social desirability of effects

3. **Kelley's Covariation Theory (1967, 1973)**
   - Three dimensions:
     - **Consensus**: Do others behave similarly?
     - **Distinctiveness**: Does person behave this way in other situations?
     - **Consistency**: Has person behaved this way before?

**Attribution Errors and Biases**:
1. **Fundamental Attribution Error (Ross, 1977)**: Over-emphasize dispositional explanations, under-emphasize situational
   - Evidence: Quiz game study, Castro study
2. **False Consensus Effect (Ross et al., 1977)**: Overestimate degree others agree with us
3. **Self-Serving Bias (Miller & Ross, 1975)**: Take credit for success, deny responsibility for failure
4. **Actor-Observer Effect (Jones & Nisbett, 1972)**: Attribute own behavior to situation, others' behavior to disposition

**II. Conformity and Group Influence**

*Two Types*:
- **Internalization**: Changing real thoughts/feelings
- **Compliance**: Public agreement without internal change

*Classic Studies*:
1. **Sherif's Autokinetic Effect (1935)**: Ambiguous situation → internalization
2. **Asch's Line Experiment (1950s)**: Unambiguous situation → compliance (37% gave incorrect response)

*Factors Affecting Conformity*:
- Group size (increases with size)
- Presence of dissenter (greatly reduces conformity)
- Culture (greater in collectivistic cultures)

*Explanations*:
- **Informational influence**: Desire to be correct (Sherif)
- **Normative influence**: Desire to be liked/accepted (Asch)

**III. Obedience**

**Milgram's Experiment (1974)**:
- 65% administered maximum 450-volt shock
- Participants showed extreme discomfort but obeyed authority
- Before experiment, psychologists predicted only sadists would comply

**Supporting Studies**:
- Hofling et al. (1966): Nurses gave potentially lethal injections (21/22 complied)
- Sheridan & King (1972): Real electric shocks to puppy
- Zimbardo's Stanford Prison Experiment (1973): Power of social situations, ended after 6 days due to ethical concerns

### Week 9: Developmental Psychology (Nov 24 - Nov 30)
**Date Range**: 24 November - 30 November
**PDF Source**: `PSYC100 GENERAL PSYCHOLOGY DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY.pdf/txt`

**Learning Outcomes**:
1. Early experiences and attachment (Harlow, Bowlby, Ainsworth)
2. Development of self-concept (Gallup's mirror test)
3. Cognitive development and Piaget's Theory (4 stages)
4. Zone of Proximal Development - Vygotsky

**Key Topics**:

**I. Attachment**

**Definition**: Intense emotional relationship specific to two people, enduring over time; separation causes stress/sorrow

*Key Researchers*:

1. **Harlow's Monkey Experiments**:
   - Monkeys preferred cloth mother (comfort) over wire mother (food)
   - Attachment based on security/comfort, not feeding
   - Isolation studies showed severe long-term emotional damage without attachment

2. **John Bowlby (1950s-60s)**:
   - Attachment is innate biological system (evolutionary)
   - Critical period: birth to ~3 years
   - Caregiver provides secure base and safe haven
   - Controversy: Emphasized mother (monotropy), but multiple attachments are normal

3. **Mary Ainsworth's Strange Situation (1970s)**:
   - Identified 4 attachment styles:
     - **Secure (~65%)**: Explores freely, distressed when caregiver leaves, easily comforted
     - **Insecure-Avoidant (~20%)**: Little distress, avoids caregiver on return
     - **Insecure-Resistant/Ambivalent (~10-15%)**: Clings, highly distressed, seeks but resists comfort
     - **Disorganized (~5-10%)**: Contradictory/confused behavior, linked to trauma

**Effects of Deprivation/Privation**:
- **Reversibility**: Czech twins and Romanian orphanages show recovery possible with intervention
- **Sensitive period**: Deprivation beyond ~6 months increases risk; beyond 24 months very high risk
- **ACEs (Adverse Childhood Experiences)**: Link between early attachment and lifelong health/wellbeing

**II. Self-Concept Development**

- Components: Self-image (who am I?), self-esteem (how I feel about myself), ideal-self (who I want to be)
- **Gallup's Mirror Test (1977)**: Chimpanzees recognize self in mirror
- **Lewis & Brooks-Gunn (1979)**: Rouge test with infants
  - Before 15 months: No self-recognition
  - 15-18 months: 5-25% touch rouge on own nose
  - 18-24 months: 75% demonstrate self-recognition

**III. Piaget's Cognitive Development Theory**

*Four Functional Invariants*:
- **Assimilation**: Fit new information into existing schemas
- **Accommodation**: Modify schemas or create new ones

*Four Stages*:

1. **Sensorimotor (0-2 years)**:
   - Understand world through sensory experiences and motor actions
   - **Object permanence** develops (~9 months)

2. **Pre-operational (2-7 years)**:
   - Symbolic representation (words, mental images)
   - Limitations:
     - No conservation (appearance changes, properties change)
     - Egocentrism (can't see others' perspective - Three Mountains Task)
     - Irreversibility (can't mentally reverse actions)
     - Animism (inanimate objects have lifelike qualities)

3. **Concrete Operational (7-11 years)**:
   - Logical operations with concrete objects
   - Can conserve, show reversibility, less egocentric
   - Still struggle with abstract transitivity tasks

4. **Formal Operational (11+ years)**:
   - Abstract and hypothetical thinking
   - Systematic hypothesis testing

**IV. Vygotsky's Alternative**

- **Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD)**: Gap between what child can do alone vs with guidance
- **Scaffolding**: Help provided by more knowledgeable other within ZPD
- Emphasizes social and cultural context (vs Piaget's individual constructivism)

### Week 10: Intelligence (Dec 1 - Dec 7)
**Date Range**: 1 December - 7 December
**PDF Source**: `PSYC100 GENERAL PSYCHOLOGY INTELLIGENCE.pdf/txt`

**Learning Outcomes**:
1. Defining intelligence
2. Four major theories of intelligence
3. Intelligence testing methods
4. Gender differences in IQ
5. Racial differences in IQ
6. The Flynn Effect

**Key Topics**:

**Definition**: "A very general mental capability that involves the ability to reason, plan, solve problems, think abstractly, comprehend complex ideas, learn quickly, and learn from experience."

**I. Theories of Intelligence**:

1. **Spearman's Two-Factor Theory (1904)**:
   - General intelligence (g) + specific abilities (s)
   - Performance = g + task-specific s

2. **Cattell's Fluid-Crystallized Theory (gf-gc, 1963)**:
   - **Fluid intelligence (gf)**: Reasoning, novel problem-solving (independent of prior knowledge)
   - **Crystallized intelligence (gc)**: Learned knowledge, skills, experience

3. **Sternberg's Triarchic Theory**:
   - Three types of intelligence (analytical, creative, practical)

4. **Gardner's Multiple Intelligences**:
   - Eight types (linguistic, logical-mathematical, spatial, musical, bodily-kinesthetic, interpersonal, intrapersonal, naturalistic)

**II. Intelligence Testing**:

1. **Stanford-Binet Test**:
   - Origin: Binet & Simon (1905) - first individual IQ test
   - Current: 5th edition (2003)
   - Mean = 100, SD = 15
   - Balanced verbal/nonverbal scales (based on gf-gc)

2. **Wechsler Tests** (Most widely used globally):
   - WPPSI-IV (2.5-6 years)
   - WISC-V (6-16 years)
   - WAIS-V (16-90 years)
   - Balanced verbal/nonverbal scales

3. **Raven's Progressive Matrices**:
   - Non-verbal, culture-reduced
   - Measures fluid intelligence

**Historical**: Army Alpha/Beta tests (WWI, 1917-1919) - first GROUP intelligence tests

**III. Gender Differences**:

- Most IQ tests constructed to show no overall difference
- **Male advantages**: Visuo-spatial tasks (mental rotation ~1 SD above females), mechanical reasoning, quantitative/math
- **Female advantages**: Verbal tasks (synonym generation, verbal fluency ~0.5-1.2 SD above males), some memory tasks
- **Explanations**: Biological (brain size, hormones, evolution) and environmental (socialization, education, gender-differentiated toys)

**IV. Racial Differences**:

- **Controversial claim**: Herrnstein & Murray (1994) "The Bell Curve" - 1 SD gap (Black mean=85, White mean=100)
- **Three proposed explanations**:
  1. Test bias (cultural knowledge of dominant group)
  2. Genetics (REJECTED by scientific consensus - race is social construct)
  3. Environment (CONSENSUS view): Systemic inequities, unequal resources, education, health
- **APA Task Force**: Agreed differences exist but attributed to cultural/environmental factors, not genetics

**V. The Flynn Effect**:

- **Observation**: IQ scores increased ~3 points per decade across 30+ countries
- **Largest gains**: Fluid intelligence (Raven's Matrices), not crystallized
- **Trend**: Slowing or reversing in developed nations (Norway, Denmark, UK) since late 1990s
- **Explanations**: Better nutrition, longer schooling, cognitive stimulation (TV, puzzles, video games), smaller families, test familiarity

**VI. Heredity vs Environment**:

- Both contribute to intelligence
- Twin studies: MZ twins more similar than DZ twins (genetic influence)
- Adoption studies: Children from disadvantaged families show IQ gains when adopted into high SES families
- Interaction between genes and environment

1. **Free Association**: Verbally report without censorship any thoughts/feelings/images
2. **Dream Interpretation**: Analyze unconscious dreams, fantasies, wishes through symbolism

**III. Humanistic Therapies**:

**Person-Centered/Client-Centered Therapy (Carl Rogers)**:

Three essential therapist attributes:
1. **Unconditional Positive Regard**: Genuine care and acceptance without judgment
2. **Empathy**: View world through client's eyes
3. **Genuineness**: Consistency between feelings and behavior

Philosophy:
- People capable of controlling actions
- Take responsibility for choices
- Possess inner resources for self-healing and growth
- Focus on present and future, not past

**IV. Cognitive Therapies**:

**A. Rational-Emotive Behavioral Therapy (REBT - Albert Ellis)**:

**ABCD Model**:
- **A**: Activating event (triggers emotion)
- **B**: Belief system (appraisal of event)
- **C**: Consequences (emotional/behavioral)
- **D**: Disputing (challenging erroneous beliefs)

**B. Cognitive Therapy (Aaron Beck)**:

- Goal: Identify faulty/negative automatic thoughts
- Focus: "The Negative Triad" in depression
  1. Negative view of self
  2. Negative view of world
  3. Negative view of future
- Help clients realize thoughts (not situations) cause maladaptive emotions

**C. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)**:

- Evidence-based, widely used
- Concept: Thoughts, feelings, behaviors are interconnected
- Process: Identify and challenge unhelpful thoughts → replace with balanced/realistic ones → encourage healthier behaviors
- Uses ABC model

**V. Behavior Therapies**:

Philosophy:
- Maladaptive behaviors ARE the problem (not symptoms)
- Learned through same processes as normal behaviors
- Can be unlearned through classical/operant conditioning and modeling

**Three Main Techniques**:

**A. Exposure Therapy**:
- Treat phobias through exposure to feared stimulus
- Highly effective for reducing anxiety
- Methods: Systematic desensitization, Flooding

**B. Aversion Therapy**:
- Pair attractive stimulus with noxious stimulus
- Goal: Condition aversion
- Examples: Alcohol treatment, pedophilia treatment
- More effective with comprehensive treatment program

## 6. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PHASE 2 (IMPLEMENTATION)

Based on this comprehensive investigation, the following recommendations are made for Phase 2:

### Content Organization
1. **Structure matches existing JSON format**: All content can be mapped to existing `courseData.json` and `week[N].json` structure
2. **Week numbering alignment**: Weeks 1-6 before Midterm I, Weeks 8-11 before Midterm II (skip Week 7 & 12 in content files)
3. **Topic granularity**: Some weeks cover single topics (Introduction, Learning), others have sub-topics that should be separate entries

### Question Generation Priority
1. **High-yield topics** for MCQ questions:
   - Attribution theories and biases (Week 8)
   - Piaget's stages characteristics (Week 9)
   - Intelligence theories comparison (Week 10)
   - Disorder classification and criteria (Week 11)
   - Therapy approaches and techniques (Week 13)

2. **Diagram/Visual opportunities**:
   - Gestalt principles (Week 5)
   - Memory models (MSM, WMM) (Week 6)
   - Piaget's stages table (Week 9)
   - Attachment styles matrix (Week 9)

### Content Warnings
1. **Sensitive topics requiring careful handling**:
   - Racial IQ differences (Week 10) - emphasize environmental explanations
   - Milgram/Zimbardo experiments (Week 8) - ethical considerations
   - Personality disorder examples (Week 11) - avoid stigmatization

### Accuracy Requirements
1. **Critical to maintain exact terminology**:
   - DSM-5 diagnostic criteria language
   - Statistical values (concordance rates, effect sizes, percentages)
   - Researcher names and dates for proper attribution
