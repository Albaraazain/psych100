    "background_context": "Week 11 covers Treatments and Therapies. Currently has 33 questions. Need more challenging questions.\n\nKEY CONTENT FROM EXTRACTED TEXT:\n\nI. BIOLOGICAL APPROACHES:\nA) Drug Therapies (psychopharmacology):\n- Antipsychotics: decrease dopamine, reduce POSITIVE symptoms (delusions/hallucinations), little effect on NEGATIVE symptoms\n- Antianxiety: reduce anxiety, side effects (drowsiness, dependence)\n- Antidepressants: \n  * Tricyclics - increase NE and serotonin\n  * MAO inhibitors - most severe side effects, dietary restrictions\n  * SSRIs - increase serotonin, milder side effects, faster symptom reduction\n  * SNRIs - increase serotonin AND norepinephrine\n- CRITICISMS: 90% may be placebo, don't cure, don't teach coping skills, high relapse\n\nB) ECT:\n- Sedative + muscle relaxant, brief shock (<1 sec), seizure\n- For severe depression with HIGH SUICIDE RISK\n- Effects can be IMMEDIATE (faster than meds)\n- No one knows why it works\n- Criticisms: relapse high, permanent memory loss risk, brain damage risk\n\nC) Psychosurgery:\n- Remove/destroy brain tissue\n- Used RARELY, last resort\n\nII. PSYCHODYNAMIC THERAPIES:\n- Focus: unconscious conflicts\n- Goal: INSIGHT (conscious awareness of psychodynamics)\n- Techniques: Free Association (uncensored thoughts), Dream Interpretation (unconscious wishes)\n\nIII. HUMANISTIC THERAPIES (Carl Rogers):\n- Person-centered/Client-centered therapy\n- THREE therapist attributes:\n  1. Unconditional Positive Regard - care without judgment\n  2. Empathy - view world through client's eyes\n  3. Genuineness - consistency between feeling and behavior\n\nIV. COGNITIVE THERAPIES:\nA) REBT (Ellis) - ABCD Model:\n- A = Activating event\n- B = Belief system (irrational beliefs cause problems)\n- C = Consequences (emotional/behavioral)\n- D = Disputing erroneous beliefs\n\nB) Cognitive Therapy (Beck):\n- Negative automatic thoughts\n- NEGATIVE TRIAD: negative views of SELF, WORLD, FUTURE\n- Thoughts (not situation) cause maladaptive reactions\n\nC) CBT:\n- Thoughts, feelings, behaviors interconnected\n- Uses ABC model\n- Challenge unhelpful thoughts, encourage behavioral changes\n\nV. BEHAVIOR THERAPIES:\n- Behaviors ARE the problem (not symptoms of underlying issue)\n- Behaviors are learned, can be unlearned\n\nA) Exposure Therapy:\n- Systematic Desensitization: GRADUAL exposure + relaxation, fear hierarchy\n- Flooding: IMMEDIATE intense exposure until anxiety decreases\n\nB) Aversion Therapy:\n- Pair attractive stimulus with noxious stimulus\n- E.g., alcohol + nausea-inducing drug\n- A Clockwork Orange example\n\nC) Token Economy:\n- Positive reinforcement (operant conditioning)\n- Tokens given for desired behavior, exchanged for reinforcers\n\nQuestion format:\n{\n  \"question\": \"?\",\n  \"difficulty\": \"learning|application|tricky\",\n  \"options\": [\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\"],\n  \"answer\": \"Exact option\",\n  \"explanation\": {\"correct\": \"...\", \"incorrect\": {\"A\": \"...\", \"B\": \"...\"}}\n}",
