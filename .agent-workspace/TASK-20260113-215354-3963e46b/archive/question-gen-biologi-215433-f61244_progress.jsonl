Coverage: (1) Antipsychotic mechanism limitation on negative symptoms (tricky - dopamine decrease doesn't affect flat affect/social withdrawal), (2) MAO inhibitor contraindication with dietary restrictions (application - patient refusing dietary limits), (3) ECT indications for severe depression with suicide risk (application - when medication fails), (4) 90% placebo effect criticism (tricky - challenges pharmacological effectiveness assumption), (5) ECT vs medication mechanism knowledge (application - we know how meds work but not why ECT works). All questions include comprehensive explanations for correct and incorrect options, require deep understanding beyond memorization, and align with the extracted content's emphasis on treatment limitations and clinical decision-making.", "progress": 100}
