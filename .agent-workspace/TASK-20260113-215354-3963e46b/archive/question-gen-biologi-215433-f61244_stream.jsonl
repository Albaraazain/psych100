I'll focus on biological treatments. Here are my 5 questions:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"question\": \"A patient with schizophrenia is prescribed antipsychotic medication. After several weeks, their hallucinations and delusions have decreased significantly, but they continue to show flat affect, social withdrawal, and lack of motivation. Why are these symptoms persisting despite the medication's effectiveness on other symptoms?\",\n    \"difficulty\": \"tricky\",\n    \"options\": [\n      \"The dosage of antipsychotic medication needs to be increased to address all symptoms equally\",\n      \"Antipsychotics primarily decrease dopamine, which reduces positive symptoms but has little effect on negative symptoms like flat affect and social withdrawal\",\n      \"The patient has developed tolerance to the medication and needs to switch to a different class of antipsychotics\",\n      \"These negative symptoms are side effects caused by the antipsychotic medication itself\"\n    ],\n    \"answer\": \"Antipsychotics primarily decrease dopamine, which reduces positive symptoms but has little effect on negative symptoms like flat affect and social withdrawal\",\n    \"explanation\": {\n      \"correct\": \"Antipsychotics work by decreasing dopamine levels in the brain, which is effective at reducing POSITIVE symptoms (delusions, hallucinations) but has LITTLE EFFECT on NEGATIVE symptoms (flat affect, social withdrawal, lack of motivation). This is a key limitation of antipsychotic medications - they don't address all symptom dimensions equally.\",\n      \"incorrect\": {\n        \"The dosage of antipsychotic medication needs to be increased to address all symptoms equally\": \"Increasing the dosage would not solve this problem because antipsychotics fundamentally have limited effectiveness on negative symptoms regardless of dose. Higher doses would increase positive symptom reduction but still wouldn't significantly impact negative symptoms.\",\n        \"The patient has developed tolerance to the medication and needs to switch to a different class of antipsychotics\": \"This is incorrect because all antipsychotics work through similar dopamine-blocking mechanisms and have the same limitation with negative symptoms. Tolerance also typically wouldn't develop this quickly, and the medication is still working on positive symptoms.\",\n        \"These negative symptoms are side effects caused by the antipsychotic medication itself\": \"While antipsychotics can cause some side effects, flat affect and social withdrawal are negative symptoms of schizophrenia itself, not medication side effects. The medication hasn't caused these symptoms - it simply cannot effectively treat them.\"\n      }\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"question\": \"A patient with major depression has not responded well to SSRIs and needs a different antidepressant. However, they are unwilling to follow strict dietary restrictions and are concerned about severe side effects. Which antidepressant class would be LEAST appropriate for this patient?\",\n    \"difficulty\": \"application\",\n    \"options\": [\n      \"Tricyclics, because they increase both norepinephrine and serotonin\",\n      \"SNRIs, because they increase both serotonin and norepinephrine\",\n      \"MAO inhibitors, because they have the most severe side effects and require dietary restrictions to avoid tyramine\",\n      \"Another SSRI, because they have milder side effects and faster symptom reduction\"\n    ],\n    \"answer\": \"MAO inhibitors, because they have the most severe side effects and require dietary restrictions to avoid tyramine\",\n    \"explanation\": {\n      \"correct\": \"MAO inhibitors would be the LEAST appropriate choice for this patient because they have the MOST SEVERE side effects of all antidepressant classes AND require strict dietary restrictions (avoiding tyramine-rich foods like aged cheese, cured meats, etc.). Since the patient explicitly stated they are unwilling to follow dietary restrictions and are concerned about severe side effects, MAO inhibitors directly contradict both of their concerns.\",\n      \"incorrect\": {\n        \"Tricyclics, because they increase both norepinephrine and serotonin\": \"While tricyclics do increase NE and serotonin, they don't require dietary restrictions and their side effects, though present, are not as severe as MAO inhibitors. This would be a more reasonable option than MAO inhibitors for this patient.\",\n        \"SNRIs, because they increase both serotonin and norepinephrine\": \"SNRIs would actually be a good alternative to SSRIs for this patient. They don't require dietary restrictions and have manageable side effects. They work through a different mechanism (affecting both serotonin and NE) which might be effective when SSRIs alone have failed.\",\n        \"Another SSRI, because they have milder side effects and faster symptom reduction\": \"While SSRIs do have milder side effects and faster symptom reduction, the patient has already NOT responded well to SSRIs, so trying another SSRI would likely be ineffective.

This scenario perfectly matches the clinical indications for ECT. The treatment can have IMMEDIATE effects (faster than medication), which is crucial for high-risk patients, and it's often used when other treatments have failed.\",\n      \"incorrect\": {\n        \"A patient with mild to moderate depression who prefers to avoid medication\": \"ECT is not a first-line treatment for mild to moderate depression. It's reserved for severe cases, particularly with high suicide risk. For mild to moderate depression, psychotherapy or medication would be more appropriate initial treatments. ECT is too invasive for this level of depression severity.\",\n        \"A patient with anxiety disorder who wants the fastest possible treatment\": \"ECT is specifically used for SEVERE DEPRESSION, not anxiety disorders. While ECT does work quickly, it's not indicated for anxiety. Antianxiety medications would be the appropriate pharmacological treatment for anxiety disorders.\",\n        \"A patient with depression who is responding well to SSRIs but wants to try ECT because they heard it works immediately\": \"If a patient is already responding well to SSRIs, there's no clinical indication to switch to ECT. ECT is used when patients DON'T respond to medication or have severe, life-threatening depression. Switching from an effective treatment to ECT (which has risks like memory loss) would be inappropriate.\"\n      }\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"question\": \"A psychology student argues that drug therapies are highly effective because they directly target brain chemistry and produce measurable symptom reduction. Which criticism of drug therapies most directly challenges the assumption that observed improvements are primarily due to the medication's pharmacological effects?\",\n    \"difficulty\": \"tricky\",\n    \"options\": [\n      \"Drug therapies do not teach patients coping skills or problem-solving strategies for managing their symptoms\",\n      \"Research suggests that up to 90% of the therapeutic effects may actually be placebo effects rather than pharmacological action\",\n      \"Drug therapies have a high relapse rate when patients discontinue medication\",\n      \"Drug therapies treat symptoms but do not cure the underlying psychological disorder\"\n    ],\n    \"answer\": \"Research suggests that up to 90% of the therapeutic effects may actually be placebo effects rather than pharmacological action\",\n    \"explanation\": {\n      \"correct\": \"This criticism DIRECTLY challenges the assumption that improvements are due to the medication's pharmacological effects. If up to 90% of effects may be PLACEBO effects, it means the observed symptom reduction might not be primarily due to the drug's chemical action on the brain, but rather due to patients' expectations and beliefs about the treatment. This fundamentally questions whether the drugs are working through their intended biological mechanisms.\",\n      \"incorrect\": {\n        \"Drug therapies do not teach patients coping skills or problem-solving strategies for managing their symptoms\": \"While this is a valid criticism of drug therapies, it doesn't challenge the assumption that the drugs are pharmacologically effective. This criticism accepts that drugs work but points out they don't provide additional psychological skills - it's about what drugs DON'T do, not whether they actually work as claimed.\",\n        \"Drug therapies have a high relapse rate when patients discontinue medication\": \"This criticism actually suggests the drugs ARE working while being taken (which is why stopping them leads to relapse). It doesn't challenge the pharmacological effectiveness - instead, it points to the temporary nature of the benefits and the need for continued use.\",\n        \"Drug therapies treat symptoms but do not cure the underlying psychological disorder\": \"This criticism acknowledges that drugs DO treat symptoms (suggesting they are pharmacologically effective), but argues they don't address root causes. Like the coping skills criticism, this accepts that drugs work but questions the completeness of the treatment, not whether the observed effects are real pharmacological effects.\"\n      }\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"question\": \"A treatment team is debating between prescribing medication and recommending electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) for a severely depressed patient. Which statement most accurately reflects a key difference between these two biological treatment approaches?\",\n    \"difficulty\": \"application\",\n    \"options\": [\n      \"Medication has been thoroughly researched and we understand its mechanisms, while ECT's therapeutic mechanism remains unknown despite its effectiveness\",\n      \"Medication carries risks of permanent memory loss and brain damage, while ECT is generally considered safer with fewer long-term risks\",\n      \"ECT is less expensive and more accessible than antidepressant medications for most patients\",\n      \"Medication must be used as a last resort after other treatments fail, while ECT can be used as a first-line treatment for any level of depression\"\n    ],\n    \"answer\": \"Medication has been thoroughly researched and we understand its mechanisms, while ECT's therapeutic mechanism remains unknown despite its effectiveness\",\n    \"explanation\": {\n      \"correct\": \"This accurately captures a fascinating difference between these treatments: we understand how antidepressants work (increasing neurotransmitters like serotonin, NE), but NO ONE KNOWS WHY ECT WORKS despite its effectiveness. ECT can produce immediate effects and is used for severe depression, but its mechanism of action remains a mystery. This highlights that effective treatments don't always require understanding of mechanism.\",\n      \"incorrect\": {\n        \"Medication carries risks of permanent memory loss and brain damage, while ECT is generally considered safer with fewer long-term risks\": \"This is backwards. ECT actually carries criticisms including high relapse rates, risks of PERMANENT MEMORY LOSS, and potential BRAIN DAMAGE. While medications have side effects, the severe risks of memory loss and brain damage are specifically associated with ECT, not medication.\",\n        \"ECT is less expensive and more accessible than antidepressant medications for most patients\": \"This is incorrect. ECT requires specialized equipment, medical facilities, anesthesia, and trained personnel, making it more expensive and less accessible than oral medications. Antidepressant medications are widely available and relatively inexpensive compared to ECT procedures.\",\n        \"Medication must be used as a last resort after other treatments fail, while ECT can be used as a first-line treatment for any level of depression\": \"This is reversed. Medications (particularly SSRIs) are typically first-line treatments for depression.
