    ],
    "answer": "They preferred the cloth mother and only went to the wire mother briefly to feed",
    "explanation": {
      "correct": "Harlow's experiments demonstrated that attachment is based on contact comfort rather than feeding. Monkeys overwhelmingly preferred the cloth mother, only visiting the wire mother briefly for feeding before returning to the soft, comforting cloth mother.",
      "incorrect": {
        "They spent equal time with both mothers": "This is incorrect because the monkeys showed a clear preference, spending most of their time clinging to the cloth mother despite her not providing food.",
        "They stayed with the wire mother since she provided food": "This contradicts Harlow's key finding. If attachment were based solely on feeding (biological needs), this would be true, but the monkeys chose comfort over food.",

    "answer": "Birth to 3 years",
    "explanation": {
      "correct": "Bowlby identified the critical period for forming primary attachment as roughly from birth to about 3 years of age. During this time, infants have an innate biological drive to form attachment bonds with caregivers.",
      "incorrect": {
        "Birth to 6 months": "This timeframe is too short. While attachment begins forming early, Bowlby's critical period extends much longer to allow for the full development of secure attachment bonds.",
        "3 to 7 years": "This is incorrect as the critical period begins at birth, not at 3 years. By age 3, the primary attachment should already be established.",
        "Birth to 12 months": "While the first year is crucial, Bowlby extended the critical period to approximately 3 years, recognizing that attachment continues to develop throughout early childhood."

    "answer": "Secure",
    "explanation": {
      "correct": "This behavior pattern is characteristic of secure attachment (~65% of infants). Securely attached children use their caregiver as a secure base for exploration, show appropriate distress during separation, and are easily comforted upon reunion.",
      "incorrect": {
        "Insecure-Avoidant": "Avoidant children show little distress when the caregiver leaves and tend to avoid or ignore them upon return, unlike the child in this scenario who shows distress and seeks comfort.",

    "answer": "Insecure-Resistant (Ambivalent)",
    "explanation": {
      "correct": "This is classic insecure-resistant/ambivalent attachment (~10-15% of infants). Key indicators are: minimal exploration, clinging behavior, high distress during separation, and the hallmark behavior of both seeking comfort AND resisting it upon reunion—the 'ambivalence'.",
      "incorrect": {
        "Secure": "Secure children explore freely, show moderate distress, and are easily comforted upon return. They don't show the resistant/pushing away behavior described here.",
        "Insecure-Avoidant": "Avoidant children explore freely without using the parent as a secure base, show minimal distress when left, and avoid/ignore the parent upon return rather than seeking then resisting contact.",
        "Disorganized": "While disorganized attachment also involves contradictory behaviors, it's characterized by confusion and freezing (e.g., approaching while looking away), often linked to trauma. The pattern here shows consistent ambivalence, not disorganization."

    ],
    "answer": "The monkeys became emotionally disturbed, socially withdrawn, and often self-harming",
    "explanation": {
      "correct": "Harlow's isolation studies demonstrated severe consequences of complete deprivation. Monkeys raised in total isolation became emotionally disturbed, socially withdrawn, self-harming, and when reintroduced to others were fearful or aggressive. This showed that attachment and social contact are essential for psychological development.",
      "incorrect": {
        "The monkeys developed normally as long as they had adequate food": "This directly contradicts Harlow's key finding—that attachment is NOT just about feeding. Physical needs alone are insufficient for healthy development.",
        "The monkeys showed enhanced independence and self-sufficiency": "This is completely opposite to the actual findings. Isolated monkeys developed severe psychological problems, not enhanced capabilities.",
        "The monkeys only showed problems if isolated beyond 6 months": "While timing matters (as seen in Romanian orphanage studies), Harlow's total isolation studies showed that any significant period of complete isolation caused severe problems regardless of specific duration."

    ],
    "answer": "Privation effects can be reversed with intensive rehabilitation, as their IQs rose to 90-100 and they lived normal adult lives",
    "explanation": {
      "correct": "The Czech twins case demonstrates that privation effects CAN be reversible with intensive intervention. After rescue, their IQs rose from ~40 to 90-100, they developed normal language and social relationships, finished school, and lived relatively normal adult lives—showing remarkable recovery despite extreme early deprivation.",
      "incorrect": {
        "Privation effects are permanent and cannot be reversed": "The Czech twins case directly contradicts this—they showed dramatic recovery, proving that with proper intervention, severe early privation can be overcome to a significant degree.",
        "Only physical development can recover from privation, not cognitive abilities": "This is false. The twins' cognitive development (IQ increase from 40 to 90-100) and social development both showed substantial recovery, not just physical aspects.",
        "Recovery from privation is only possible if it occurs before age 2": "The twins were rescued at age 7, well beyond age 2, yet still showed remarkable recovery. However, the Romanian orphanage studies do suggest earlier intervention (before 6-24 months) leads to better outcomes."

      "incorrect": {
        "Food provision and shelter": "While these are important physical needs, Bowlby's attachment theory emphasizes emotional and psychological functions. Harlow's experiments specifically showed attachment is about more than meeting biological needs.",
        "Education and discipline": "These are parenting functions but not the core attachment functions Bowlby identified. Attachment theory focuses on the emotional security relationship, not teaching or behavior management.",

Between 15-18 months, 5-25% of infants touched it, and 75% of 18-24 month-old infants demonstrated self-recognition by touching their own nose, indicating developing self-awareness.",
      "incorrect": {

    "answer": "Assimilation",
    "explanation": {
      "correct": "This is assimilation—the process of taking in new information (the cow) and fitting it into an existing schema (the 'dog' schema) without changing that schema. The child uses her existing knowledge structure to interpret the new animal.",
      "incorrect": {
        "Accommodation": "Accommodation would occur if the child modified her schema after learning the cow is different from dogs. For example, creating a new 'cow' category or adjusting her understanding of what makes an animal a dog versus other farm animals.",

      "correct": "This is a classic conservation task. The child in the preoperational stage (2-7 years) fails to understand the principle of conservation—that basic properties like quantity stay the same even when appearance changes. They focus on the height and conclude there's more water.",

        "Object permanence": "Object permanence is understanding that objects continue to exist when out of sight, developed during the sensorimotor stage (0-2 years). A 5-year-old has already mastered this.",

        "Conservation": "Conservation relates to understanding that properties like quantity stay constant despite appearance changes. The child's attribution of feelings to objects is unrelated to conservation.",
        "Egocentrism": "While the sun 'following her' shows some egocentrism (seeing herself as the center), the key feature here is attributing intentions and emotions to non-living things (animism). Egocentrism is more about perspective-taking difficulties.",
