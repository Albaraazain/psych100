      "The brain interprets individual sensory elements as isolated units",
      "Perception emerges from organizing sensory information into meaningful wholes",
      "Sensory stimuli must be processed separately before being combined",
      "Pattern recognition requires analyzing each component individually"
    ],
    "answer": "Perception emerges from organizing sensory information into meaningful wholes",
    "explanation": {
      "correct": "This is the core principle of Gestalt psychology - that the brain organizes sensory information into meaningful wholes, creating a unified perception that is greater than simply the sum of individual parts. The example given in the lecture is a melody: individual notes are just separate sounds, but together they form a recognizable melody with a unique quality.",
      "incorrect": {
        "The brain interprets individual sensory elements as isolated units": "This contradicts Gestalt theory, which emphasizes that perception is holistic rather than piecemeal.",
        "Sensory stimuli must be processed separately before being combined": "Gestalt theory suggests organization happens naturally and immediately, not through sequential processing.",
        "Pattern recognition requires analyzing each component individually": "This is the opposite of Gestalt principles, which emphasize perceiving patterns as unified wholes."

    "answer": "Proximity",
    "explanation": {
      "correct": "The principle of proximity states that elements placed close together tend to be perceived as a group. By placing related buttons near each other, the designer leverages this principle to help users understand which functions belong together.",
      "incorrect": {
        "Similarity": "This principle involves grouping elements that look similar (same color, shape, etc.), not about physical closeness.",
        "Closure": "Closure involves completing incomplete forms or filling in gaps, not about spatial arrangement.",

    "answer": "Figure-ground separation",
    "explanation": {
      "correct": "Figure-ground separation is the perceptual task of recognizing an object (figure) as distinct from its surroundings (ground). In reversible figures, the same visual elements can be perceived as either figure or ground, demonstrating this fundamental principle of perceptual organization.",

    "answer": "Closure",
    "explanation": {
      "correct": "Closure is the tendency to complete incomplete forms and fill in gaps. When we see dashed lines forming a circular pattern, our brain automatically completes the gaps to perceive a whole circle rather than separate line segments.",
      "incorrect": {
        "Proximity": "This involves grouping elements that are close together, not completing incomplete shapes.",

    "answer": "Convergence",
    "explanation": {
      "correct": "Convergence is a binocular cue (requires both eyes) and non-pictorial cue (involves physical functioning of eyes/brain). It refers to the inward rotation of eyes to focus on nearby objects, with the degree of convergence providing depth information.",
      "incorrect": {
        "Linear perspective": "This is a monocular pictorial cue - it's a feature of the visual field itself (parallel lines converging), not eye movement.",
        "Relative size": "This is a monocular pictorial cue based on visual patterns, not binocular eye function.",

    ],
    "answer": "Comparing the slightly different images projected on each retina",
    "explanation": {
      "correct": "Retinal disparity (also called binocular disparity) is the slight difference in images projected on each retina due to the eyes' horizontal separation. The brain uses this disparity to estimate depth, especially for objects within a few meters.",

    ],
    "answer": "Interposition",
    "explanation": {
      "correct": "Interposition (occlusion) is a monocular pictorial cue where one object partially blocks another, indicating the blocked object is farther away. It's pictorial because it's a feature of the visual field itself, and monocular because it works with one eye.",
      "incorrect": {
        "Convergence": "This is a binocular non-pictorial cue involving eye rotation.",
        "Retinal disparity": "This is a binocular non-pictorial cue based on different images in each eye.",

      "Aerial perspective",
      "Texture gradient"
    ],
    "answer": "Aerial perspective",
    "explanation": {
      "correct": "Aerial perspective (atmospheric perspective) occurs when distant objects appear hazier or less vivid due to atmospheric scattering of light. This causes distant mountains to look bluish and less detailed, suggesting greater distance.",
      "incorrect": {
        "Linear perspective": "This involves parallel lines converging in the distance, not the hazy appearance of distant objects.",
        "Relative height": "This refers to objects higher in the visual field being perceived as farther away, not their haziness.",

      "Distal varies constantly; proximal remains constant"
    ],
    "answer": "Distal is the actual object; proximal is the pattern on the retina",
    "explanation": {
      "correct": "The distal stimulus is the actual object you're looking at (external), while the proximal stimulus is the pattern of stimulation that hits your retina (internal). A major issue for perception is how perception remains constant when the proximal stimulus varies so much (e.g., as objects move closer or farther).",
      "incorrect": {
        "Distal is what we perceive; proximal is what actually exists": "This is backwards - distal is what actually exists, and perception is constructed from the proximal stimulus.",
        "Distal is monocular; proximal is binocular": "These terms don't relate to monocular vs binocular vision.",

    ],
    "answer": "Perceive an object's size as unchanging despite changes in retinal image size",
    "explanation": {
      "correct": "Size constancy is the brain's ability to perceive an object's size as constant even though its retinal image changes with distance. For example, a person appears the same size whether 5 or 50 feet away, despite the retinal image being much smaller at greater distance.",
      "incorrect": {
        "Accurately measure the absolute size of all objects": "Size constancy is about perceptual stability, not accurate measurement of absolute dimensions.",
        "See objects as larger when they are farther away": "This is the opposite - retinal images get smaller with distance, but size constancy compensates to maintain perceived size.",

    "answer": "Size constancy",
    "explanation": {
      "correct": "In the Ames room, the walls, floor, and ceiling are trapezoidal, not rectangular. Your brain incorrectly interprets both corners as being at the same distance when they're not, causing a failure of size constancy - people in different corners appear drastically different in size even though they're similar heights.",
      "incorrect": {
        "Colour constancy": "The Ames room doesn't manipulate colour perception under different lighting.",
        "Shape constancy": "While the room's actual shape is trapezoidal, the illusion primarily affects perceived size of people in the room.",

      "correct": "Shape constancy is the perception of an object's shape as consistent even when viewed from different angles that alter its retinal projection. A door is a perfect example - it projects different shapes on the retina depending on viewing angle, but we always perceive it as rectangular.",
      "incorrect": {
        "Size constancy": "This involves perceiving consistent size at different distances, not shape from different angles.",

    ],
    "answer": "Depth cues trigger perceptual interpretation based on experience with corners",
    "explanation": {
      "correct": "The Müller-Lyer illusion is explained by Gregory's constructivist theory - the fins act as depth cues. Outgoing fins resemble the far corner of a room (appearing farther away, so brain compensates by perceiving it as larger), while ingoing fins resemble a near corner. Our brain uses past experience with 3D environments to interpret these 2D patterns.",
      "incorrect": {
        "The lines are actually different lengths": "The lines are identical in length - that's why it's an illusion.",
