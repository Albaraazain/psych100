    "answer": "Low consensus (few students failed), low distinctiveness (Sarah failed other exams too), high consistency (Sarah often fails exams)",
    "explanation": {
      "correct": "This combination points to internal attribution. Low consensus suggests Sarah's behavior is unusual compared to others. Low distinctiveness indicates the behavior generalizes across situations (she fails multiple exams, not just this one). High consistency shows the pattern repeats over time.

    "question": "Which of the following scenarios would most likely result in EXTERNAL attribution according to Kelley's Covariation Theory?",
    "difficulty": "tricky",
    "options": [
      "Low consensus, low distinctiveness, high consistency",
      "High consensus, high distinctiveness, high consistency",
      "Low consensus, high distinctiveness, low consistency",
      "High consensus, low distinctiveness, low consistency"
    ],
    "answer": "High consensus, high distinctiveness, high consistency",
    "explanation": {
      "correct": "High consensus (everyone acts this way), high distinctiveness (the behavior is unique to this situation), and high consistency (it happens repeatedly) all point to something about the external stimulus/situation causing the behavior. For example, if Sarah fails an exam (high consensus: everyone failed, high distinctiveness: she passes other exams, high consistency: this exam is consistently difficult), we attribute it to the exam being hard (external), not Sarah's ability.",
      "incorrect": {
        "Low consensus, low distinctiveness, high consistency": "This pattern leads to internal attribution. The person behaves differently from others (low consensus), the behavior generalizes across situations (low distinctiveness), and it's consistent over time - suggesting something about the person.",
        "Low consensus, high distinctiveness, low consistency": "This combination is ambiguous but might suggest an unusual circumstance. It doesn't show the clear external attribution pattern.",
        "High consensus, low distinctiveness, low consistency": "Low consistency undermines attribution. If the behavior is inconsistent, it's hard to identify a stable cause, whether internal or external."

      "Informational influence occurs in collectivistic cultures; normative influence occurs in individualistic cultures",
      "Informational influence involves desire to be correct in ambiguous situations; normative influence involves desire to be liked and accepted",

    "answer": "Informational influence involves desire to be correct in ambiguous situations; normative influence involves desire to be liked and accepted",
    "explanation": {
      "correct": "Informational influence occurs when the situation is ambiguous and you rely on others for information to be correct (Sherif's autokinetic study). Normative influence occurs when you conform to be liked and avoid social disapproval, even when the situation is clear (Asch's line study). The key distinction is motivation: accuracy vs social acceptance.",
      "incorrect": {
        "Informational influence occurs in collectivistic cultures; normative influence occurs in individualistic cultures": "Both types of influence occur in all cultures, though collectivistic cultures may show more conformity overall.",
        "Informational influence affects men more than women; normative influence affects women more than men": "Gender differences in conformity are not the defining distinction between these two types of social influence.",
        "Informational influence requires a large group; normative influence can occur with just one other person": "Both types can occur with varying group sizes. The distinction is about motivation and task ambiguity, not group size."
