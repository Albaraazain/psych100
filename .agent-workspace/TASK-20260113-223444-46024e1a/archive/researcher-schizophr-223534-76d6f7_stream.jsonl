Which diagnosis?\" (Answer: Schizophreniform)\n   - \"Symptoms began 8 months ago and persist. Which diagnosis?\" (Answer: Schizophrenia)\n   - \"Delusions present for 3 weeks, then resolved. Which diagnosis?\" (Answer: Brief Psychotic)\n\n2. **Boundary Questions (Tricky):**\n   - \"What happens to diagnosis if Brief Psychotic symptoms last exactly 30 days?\" (Answer: Still Brief Psychotic; must be <1 month)\n   - \"Patient has symptoms for 5.5 months - schizophreniform or schizophrenia?\" (Answer: Schizophreniform; not yet 6 months)\n\n3. **Progression Questions:**\n   - \"Schizophreniform can progress to what disorder?\" (Answer: Schizophrenia if symptoms persist >6 months)\n\n**ADHD-Friendly Explanation Style:**\n- Use visual timeline: \"1 day → <1 month → 1-6 months → ≥6 months\"\n- Concrete anchors: \"4 months = schizophreniform, 8 months = schizophrenia\"\n- Mechanism: \"Why 6 months? Marks transition from acute to chronic brain changes\"\n\n---\n\n### Theme 2: FUNCTIONING LEVEL DISTINCTIONS (High Priority)\n\n**Concept:** Functioning separates delusional disorder from others\n\n**Question Types:**\n1. **Delusional Disorder Identification:**\n   - \"Patient works full-time, dresses normally, but believes FBI monitors them. Diagnosis?\" (Answer: Delusional disorder - functioning intact)\n   - \"Why can someone with delusional disorder work as bus driver but schizophrenia patient cannot?\" (Answer: Impairment only within delusion system vs global decline)\n\n2. **Comparison Questions:**\n   - \"Compare functioning in schizophrenia vs delusional disorder\" (Answer: Significant decline vs intact outside delusion)\n   - \"Which requires 'significant functional decline' for diagnosis?\" (Answer: Schizophrenia)\n\n3. **Case-Based:**\n   - Use the 58-year-old bus driver case (persecutory delusions + aluminum foil but works daily)\n   - Use the 45-year-old accountant case (erotomanic delusions but full-time work)\n\n**ADHD-Friendly Explanation Style:**\n- Concrete comparison: \"Delusional = works, socializes, normal life EXCEPT the one belief; Schizophrenia = can't work, withdrawn, global problems\"\n- Mechanism: \"Delusional disorder affects ONLY belief system; schizophrenia disrupts entire cognitive/emotional processing\"\n\n---\n\n### Theme 3: SYMPTOM COMPLEXITY (Medium Priority)\n\n**Concept:** Number and types of symptoms vary across disorders\n\n**Question Types:**\n1. **Symptom Count:**\n   - \"Which disorder has ONLY delusions, no other psychotic symptoms?\" (Answer: Delusional disorder)\n   - \"Which disorders can have full psychotic syndrome?\" (Answer: Schizophrenia, schizophreniform, brief psychotic)\n\n2. **Positive vs Negative:**\n   - \"What are negative symptoms in schizophrenia?\" (Answer: Flat/blunt affect, avolition, alogia)\n   - \"Does delusional disorder include negative symptoms?\" (Answer: No)\n\n3. **Specific Symptoms:**\n   - \"What is 'clanging'?\" (Answer: Nonsensical rhyming speech pattern)\n   - Use the actual dialogue from PDF as question stimulus\n\n**ADHD-Friendly Explanation Style:**\n- Visual breakdown: \"Schizophrenia = delusions + hallucinations + disorganized speech + negative symptoms; Delusional = ONLY delusions\"\n- Mechanism for negative symptoms: \"Brain's reward/motivation circuits damaged → can't feel pleasure or initiate action\"\n\n---\n\n### Theme 4: DELUSION TYPES (Medium-High Priority)\n\n**Concept:** 7 specific delusion types with distinct content\n\n**Question Types:**\n1. **Type Identification:**\n   - \"Patient believes thoughts are being removed from mind. Which delusion type?\" (Answer: Thought withdrawal)\n   - \"Patient believes TV news contains special messages for them. Which type?\" (Answer: Delusions of reference)\n   - \"Patient believes they're a secret royal. Which type?\" (Answer: Grandiose)\n\n2. **Multiple Choice with Cases:**\n   - Present the 38-year-old parasite case → \"What type of delusion?\" (Answer: Somatic)\n   - Present the 50-year-old jealous husband → \"What type?\" (Answer: Jealous)\n\n3. **Tricky Distinctions:**\n   - \"Persecutory vs delusions of control\" (Answer: Being harmed by others vs external forces controlling you)\n   - \"Grandiose vs erotomanic\" (Answer: I'm special/powerful vs someone special loves me)\n\n**ADHD-Friendly Explanation Style:**\n- Categories with examples:\n  - Persecutory = \"They're out to get me\" (FBI, neighbors)\n  - Reference = \"That's about ME\" (TV, songs)\n  - Grandiose = \"I'm secretly amazing\" (royalty, genius)\n  - Control = \"They control my thoughts/actions\"\n  - Somatic = \"My body has X wrong\" (parasites, disease)\n  - Nihilistic = \"Nothing is real\" (world ended)\n  - Erotomanic = \"Celebrity loves me\"\n\n---\n\n### Theme 5: SCHIZOAFFECTIVE DISTINCTION (High Priority - Tricky)\n\n**Concept:** Requires BOTH psychosis AND mood episodes\n\n**Question Types:**\n1. **Diagnostic Criteria:**\n   - \"What makes schizoaffective different from schizophrenia?\" (Answer: Presence of mood episodes)\n   - \"Can someone have schizophrenia with depression?\" (Answer: Yes, but schizoaffective requires mood EPISODES that meet full criteria)\n\n2. **Case-Based:**\n   - Use the 28-year-old case with hallucinations + delusions + depressive episodes + elevated mood\n\n3. **Temporal Patterns (Very Tricky):**\n   - \"What's the difference between schizoaffective and bipolar with psychotic features?\" (Answer: Schizoaffective has psychosis even WITHOUT mood episodes; bipolar only has psychosis DURING mood episodes)\n\n**ADHD-Friendly Explanation Style:**\n- Timeline diagram:\n  ```\n  Schizoaffective: [Psychosis always present] + [Mood episodes come and go]\n  Bipolar w/ psychosis: [Psychosis ONLY during mood episodes]\n  Schizophrenia: [Psychosis] [No mood episodes]\n  ```\n- Mechanism: \"Two separate brain system problems: thought processing (psychosis) + mood regulation (depression/mania)\"\n\n---\n\n### Theme 6: BRIEF PSYCHOTIC DISORDER (Medium Priority)\n\n**Concept:** Stress-triggered, short-lived, complete recovery\n\n**Question Types:**\n1. **Case Identification:**\n   - Present the 24-year-old college student case → multiple questions:\n     - \"What was the trigger?\" (Exams + argument)\n     - \"How long did it last?\" (12 days)\n     - \"What was the outcome?\" (Complete recovery)\n\n2. **Prognosis Questions:**\n   - \"Which disorder has best prognosis?\" (Answer: Brief psychotic - full recovery)\n   - \"What indicates brief psychotic vs schizophreniform?\" (Answer: Full return to baseline + duration <1 month)\n\n3. **Stressor Relationship:**\n   - \"Is stress required for brief psychotic disorder?\" (Answer: Often present but not required)\n\n**ADHD-Friendly Explanation Style:**\n- Story format: \"Student under extreme stress → brain's stress response overloads → temporary psychosis (like circuit breaker) → resets with treatment\"\n- Concrete: \"Think of it like a psychological 'fever' - intense but temporary response to overwhelming situation\"\n\n---\n\n### Theme 7: HALLUCINATION SPECIFICS (Low-Medium Priority)\n\n**Concept:** Auditory hallucinations most common in schizophrenia\n\n**Question Types:**\n1. **Type Questions:**\n   - \"What type of hallucination is MOST common in schizophrenia?\" (Answer: Auditory)\n   - \"What makes hallucinations different from illusions?\" (Answer: Hallucinations have no external stimulus)\n\n2. **Clinical Characteristics:**\n   - \"What does 'compelling sense of reality' mean?\" (Answer: Person experiences hallucination as real, not imagined)\n\n**ADHD-Friendly Explanation Style:**\n- Mechanism: \"Brain's auditory processing areas activate WITHOUT external sound → person hears voices that aren't there\"\n- Comparison: \"Like hearing your name called when no one did - but constant and elaborate\"\n\n---\n\n### Theme 8: CLANGING EXAMPLE (High Priority - Informative)\n\n**Concept:** Disorganized speech pattern with rhyming\n\n**Question Types:**\n1. **Definition:**\n   - \"What is clanging?\" (Answer: Nonsensical rhyming speech pattern)\n\n2. **Recognition:**\n   - Present the actual dialogue from PDF → \"What symptom is demonstrated?\"\n\n3. **Symptom Category:**\n   - \"Is clanging a positive or negative symptom?\" (Answer: Positive - disorganized speech)\n   - \"Which disorder shows clanging?\" (Answer: Schizophrenia, schizophreniform - any with disorganized speech)\n\n**ADHD-Friendly Explanation Style:**\n- Use actual example from PDF\n- Mechanism: \"Brain's language center prioritizes sound/rhyme over meaning → words chosen by how they sound, not what they mean\"\n- Concrete: \"Like poetry mode stuck ON when trying to have normal conversation\"\n\n---\n\n### Theme 9: NEGATIVE SYMPTOMS (Medium Priority)\n\n**Concept:** Absence/reduction of normal functions\n\n**Question Types:**\n1. **Types:**\n   - \"What is flat affect?\" (Answer: No emotional expression)\n   - \"What is blunt affect?\" (Answer: Reduced emotional expression)\n   - \"Difference between flat and inappropriate affect?\" (Answer: Flat = none; inappropriate = wrong emotion for context)\n\n2. **Positive vs Negative:**\n   - \"Why are delusions called 'positive' symptoms?\" (Answer: Adding something not normally there)\n   - \"Why is flat affect 'negative'?\" (Answer: Removing/reducing normal emotional expression)\n\n3. **Impact:**\n   - \"How do negative symptoms affect functioning?\" (Answer: Impair social interaction, motivation, communication)\n\n**ADHD-Friendly Explanation Style:**\n- Simple distinction: \"Positive = ADDS abnormal things (hallucinations, delusions); Negative = REMOVES normal things (emotions, motivation)\"\n- Mechanism: \"Brain's emotional processing centers damaged → can't generate/express feelings even if wanted to\"\n\n---\n\n## QUESTION DIFFICULTY DISTRIBUTION\n\n### EASY (Informative, Basic Knowledge):\n- Define each disorder\n- Identify symptoms from list\n- Match duration to disorder\n- What is clanging?\n\n### MEDIUM (Application, Requires Understanding):\n- Case-based diagnosis\n- Compare two disorders\n- Explain why symptom fits category\n- Identify delusion type from scenario\n\n### HARD (Deep Understanding, Tricky Distinctions):\n- Schizoaffective vs bipolar with psychosis\n- Why delusional disorder patient can work but schizophrenia cannot\n- Boundary cases (exactly 30 days of symptoms)\n- Explain mechanism of negative symptoms\n\n### VERY TRICKY (Requires Critical Thinking):\n- Thought insertion vs thought broadcasting distinction\n- When does schizophreniform become schizophrenia?\n- Why is psychosis during mood episode NOT enough for schizoaffective?\n- Delusions of reference vs paranoid personality disorder\n\n---\n\n## RECOMMENDED QUESTION MIX FOR 15+ QUESTIONS\n\n1. **Duration-based (3 questions):** Timeline, boundary case, progression\n2. **Functioning level (2 questions):** Delusional vs schizophrenia, case-based\n3. **Schizoaffective (2-3 questions):** Criteria, case, temporal distinction\n4. **Delusion types (3 questions):** Type identification from cases\n5. **Brief psychotic (2 questions):** Case analysis, prognosis\n6. **Symptoms (2-3 questions):** Clanging, negative symptoms, positive vs negative\n7. **General (1-2 questions):** Definition, symptom matching\n\n**Total:** 15-18 questions covering all critical concepts\n\n---\n\n## ADHD-FRIENDLY EXPLANATION REQUIREMENTS\n\n### For EVERY explanation, include:\n\n1. **Concrete Example:** Real scenario or case from PDF\n2. **Visual/Spatial Element:** Timeline, comparison chart, or visual metaphor\n3. **Mechanism:** WHY it works this way (brain/cognitive process)\n4. **Anchor:** Memorable phrase or comparison\n5. **Distinction:** What it's NOT (common confusion)\n\n### Example Template:\n```\nQ: \"Patient has delusions for 4 months. Diagnosis?\"\nA: \"Schizophreniform disorder\"\n\nExplanation:\nDURATION TIMELINE: 1 day → <1 month (brief) → 1-6 months (schizophreniform) → ≥6 months (schizophrenia)\n\nCONCRETE: 4 months falls in the 1-6 month window = schizophreniform.\n\nMECHANISM: The 6-month cutoff marks when acute symptoms transition to chronic brain changes. Before 6 months, there's still possibility of full recovery; after 6 months, brain changes become more persistent.\n\nDISTINCTION: Not schizophrenia yet (needs ≥6 months). Not brief psychotic (that's <1 month).\n\nCLINICAL POINT: If symptoms continue past 6 months, diagnosis CHANGES to schizophrenia.\n```\n\n---\n\n## CONTENT READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION\n\n**Status:** Complete extraction with 100% coverage of PDF content\n**Output:** Comprehensive details document + question themes document\n**Next step:** Implementation team can create week10.json questions using this foundation\n\n**Quality indicators:**\n- All 5 disorders documented with exact criteria\n- 7 clinical cases extracted verbatim\n- 7 delusion types catalogued\n- Clear distinctions between all disorders\n- 9 question themes identified\n- ADHD-friendly explanation framework provided\n- Difficulty distribution planned\n"}}],"stop_reason":"tool_use","stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":0,"cache_creation_input_tokens":680,"cache_read_input_tokens":66550,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":680,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":4085,"service_tier":"standard"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"bd170159-dca2-4179-a62a-d1983520fbb7","uuid":"75cd336e-d396-4f92-a902-ec5c0e0ad043"}

Duration-based differentiation (3 questions)\n2. Functioning level distinctions (2 questions)\n3. Symptom complexity (2-3 questions)\n4. Delusion types (3 questions)\n5. Schizoaffective distinction (2-3 questions)\n6. Brief psychotic disorder (2 questions)\n7. Hallucination specifics (1-2 questions)\n8. Clanging example (1-2 questions)\n9. Negative symptoms (2 questions)\n\n---\n\n## KEY INSIGHTS DISCOVERED\n\n### Insight 1: Duration is Primary Differentiator\n**Discovery:** The spectrum uses duration as the MAIN diagnostic criterion:\n- 1 day to <1 month = Brief Psychotic Disorder\n- 1-6 months = Schizophreniform Disorder\n- ≥6 months = Schizophrenia\n- ≥1 month (delusions only) = Delusional Disorder\n\n**Implication:** Questions should emphasize temporal boundaries and \"what happens at 6 months\" concept.\n\n---\n\n### Insight 2: Functioning Level Separates Delusional Disorder\n**Discovery:** Delusional disorder is unique because functioning is INTACT outside the delusion system. All 4 PDF examples showed:\n- Full-time employment maintained (accountant, bus driver)\n- Normal appearance and social interaction\n- No global impairment\n\n**Implication:** Strong contrast questions possible: \"Why can delusional disorder patient work but schizophrenia patient cannot?\"\n\n---\n\n### Insight 3: Schizoaffective is Diagnostically Complex\n**Discovery:** Requires BOTH:\n- Psychotic symptoms (even when mood is normal)\n- Mood episodes (that meet full criteria)\n\n**Distinction from similar diagnoses:**\n- vs Schizophrenia: Must have mood episodes\n- vs Bipolar with psychosis: Must have psychosis even WITHOUT mood episodes\n\n**Implication:** This is a \"tricky\" question topic - requires deep understanding of temporal patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Insight 4: Clanging Example is Concrete Teaching Tool\n**Discovery:** PDF provides complete dialogue demonstrating clanging:\n```\nTH: 'What colour is your dress?'\nCL: 'Red . . .
