## Important Clinical Notes

1. **Personality disorders are PERVASIVE patterns** - they affect multiple areas of life (relationships, work, self-perception), not just isolated behaviors

2. **Ego-syntonic vs. Ego-dystonic:**
   - Most personality disorders are EGO-SYNTONIC (person doesn't see the pattern as problematic)
   - This makes treatment challenging

3. **Onset:** Usually evident by adolescence or early adulthood and persists throughout life

4. **Functional impairment:** The patterns must cause significant distress or impairment

5. **Cultural context matters:** What's considered "odd" or "dramatic" varies by culture

6. **Comorbidity is common:** Many people meet criteria for multiple personality disorders, especially within the same cluster

## Question-Writing Focus Areas

### Concrete behaviors to test understanding:
1. **Cluster differentiation:** Given a behavior, identify which cluster
2. **Within-cluster distinctions:** What makes paranoid different from schizoid?
3. **Ego-syntonic vs ego-dystonic:** OCPD vs OCD distinction
4. **Fear vs. desire patterns:** Avoidant wants connection but fears rejection; schizoid has no desire
5. **Celebrity/historical examples:** Stalin (paranoid), Ted Bundy (antisocial), etc.
6. **Clinical scenarios:** Apply diagnostic criteria to case vignettes
7. **Interpersonal patterns:** How each disorder affects relationships differently
8. **Distinguishing from other disorders:** NPD vs antisocial, BPD vs bipolar, etc.

### Tricky distinctions to test:
- Schizoid (no desire) vs. Avoidant (desires but fears)
- Borderline (deep emotions, abandonment) vs. Histrionic (shallow emotions, attention)
- Narcissistic (admiration) vs. Histrionic (general attention)
- OCPD (personality pattern, ego-syntonic) vs. OCD (anxiety disorder, ego-dystonic)
- Antisocial (no remorse) vs. Narcissistic (fragile ego)
- Borderline mood swings (hours, reactive) vs. Bipolar (weeks, not situational)
- Schizotypal (odd beliefs, ideas of reference) vs. Schizophrenia (full delusions/hallucinations)

### Mechanism-focused explanations needed:
- WHY does borderline person split (all-good/all-bad)?
- HOW does narcissist's fragile self-esteem drive grandiosity?
- WHAT maintains avoidant's pattern (fear reinforces avoidance)?
- WHY does dependent person urgently seek new relationships?
- HOW does antisocial person rationalize harmful behavior?
