## 1. SCHIZOPHRENIA

### Exact Diagnostic Criteria (Lines 273-278)
- **Duration:** ≥6 months (chronic disorder)
- **Core feature:** Persistent psychotic symptoms
- **Functioning:** Significant decline in functioning required
- **Course:** Long-term and disabling without treatment

### Required Symptoms (Lines 274-276, 280-308)
Must have persistent symptoms from these categories:

#### Positive Symptoms:
1. **Delusions** (false beliefs sustained despite evidence)
2. **Hallucinations** (false perceptions with compelling reality - mostly auditory)
3. **Disorganized speech/thought**
4. **Disorganized behavior**

#### Negative Symptoms (Lines 293-295):
- **Blunt affect** (reduced emotional expression)
- **Flat affect** (no emotional expression)
- **Inappropriate affect** (emotion doesn't match context)

### Specific Symptom Details

#### Types of Delusions (Lines 298-308):

1. **Persecutory delusions** - Belief of being harmed, watched, or targeted by others
2. **Delusions of reference** - Belief that neutral events or media have special personal significance
3. **Grandiose delusions** - Belief of having exceptional power, wealth, identity, or abilities
4. **Delusions of control** - Belief that thoughts, feelings, or actions are controlled by external forces
5. **Thought delusions** - Includes:
   - Thought insertion
   - Thought withdrawal
   - Thought broadcasting
6. **Somatic delusions** - False beliefs about bodily functions or physical abnormalities
7. **Nihilistic delusions** - Belief that oneself, others, or the world does not exist or has ended

#### Hallucinations (Lines 284-285):
- **Primary type:** Auditory (mostly)
- **Nature:** False perceptions with compelling sense of reality

#### Disorganized Speech (Lines 286-319):
- **Pattern:** Nonsensical, rhyming patterns
- **Clinical term:** Clanging

**Clinical Example - Clanging (Lines 310-318):**
```
TH: 'What colour is your dress?'
CL: 'Red . . . Like a bed.'
TH: 'Why is it like a bed?'
CL: 'Because it's dead.'
TH: 'Why is a bed like being dead?'
CL: 'I dunno . . . maybe it's a med.'
TH: 'What's a med?'
CL: 'A bled.'
```

### Functioning Requirements
- **Impairment level:** Significant decline required
- **Areas affected:** Multiple life domains
- **Severity:** Disabling without treatment

### Key Distinguishing Features
- **Duration** is the primary distinguisher from schizophreniform (≥6 months vs 1-6 months)
- **No mood episodes** (unlike schizoaffective)
- **Chronic course** (unlike brief psychotic disorder)
- **Functional impairment** (unlike delusional disorder)

---

## 2. SCHIZOPHRENIFORM DISORDER

### Exact Diagnostic Criteria (Lines 320-324)
- **Duration:** 1-6 months (shorter than schizophrenia)
- **Symptom pattern:** SAME as schizophrenia
- **Functioning:** May be impaired BUT long-term impairment NOT required
- **Prognosis:** Can progress to schizophrenia if symptoms persist beyond 6 months

### Required Symptoms
**IDENTICAL to schizophrenia:**
- Delusions
- Hallucinations
- Disorganized speech
- Disorganized behavior
- Negative symptoms

### Duration Requirements
- **Minimum:** 1 month
- **Maximum:** 6 months
- **Critical threshold:** If symptoms persist >6 months → reclassified as schizophrenia

### Functioning/Impairment Level
- **During episode:** Functioning may be impaired
- **Long-term:** Long-term impairment NOT required for diagnosis
- **Key difference from schizophrenia:** Less emphasis on chronic functional decline

### Key Distinguishing Features
1. **vs Schizophrenia:** Duration only (1-6 months vs ≥6 months)
2. **vs Brief Psychotic:** Longer duration (1-6 months vs 1 day to <1 month)
3. **vs Schizoaffective:** No mood episodes required
4. **Prognostic indicator:** May be transitional diagnosis before schizophrenia

---

## 3. SCHIZOAFFECTIVE DISORDER

### Exact Diagnostic Criteria (Lines 326-335)
- **Dual features:** BOTH psychotic symptoms AND mood episodes
- **Mood episode types:** Major depressive OR manic episodes
- **Temporal requirement:** Both must be present (not just sequential)

### Required Symptoms

#### Psychotic Component:
- Auditory hallucinations
- Persecutory delusions
- Other schizophrenia-spectrum symptoms

#### Mood Component (must include ONE or BOTH):
1. **Major depressive episodes**
2. **Periods of elevated mood** with:
   - Decreased need for sleep
   - Increased goal-directed activity

### Clinical Example from PDF (Lines 331-335):
**Case Description:**
- **Age:** 28-year-old individual
- **History duration:** Two years
- **Psychotic symptoms:**
  - Auditory hallucinations
  - Persecutory delusions
- **Mood symptoms:**
  - Recurrent major depressive episodes
  - Periods of elevated mood with decreased need for sleep
  - Increased goal-directed activity

### Key Distinguishing Features
1. **vs Schizophrenia:** Schizoaffective includes prominent mood episodes; schizophrenia does not
2. **vs Bipolar/Depression with psychotic features:** In schizoaffective, psychosis occurs even WITHOUT mood episodes
3. **Diagnostic complexity:** Must have psychosis during mood episodes AND psychosis independent of mood
4. **Timeline pattern:** Mood episodes are recurrent, not just single occurrences

---

## 4. BRIEF PSYCHOTIC DISORDER

### Exact Diagnostic Criteria (Lines 337-351)
- **Duration:** 1 day to <1 month (very short-lived)
- **Onset:** Sudden
- **Resolution:** Full return to baseline functioning after episode
- **Trigger:** Often (but not always) triggered by stress

### Required Symptoms (Lines 338-339)
Must have sudden onset of at least one:
1. **Delusions**
2. **Hallucinations**
3. **Disorganized speech**
4. **Disorganized behavior**

### Duration Requirements
- **Minimum:** 1 day
- **Maximum:** Less than 1 month (if ≥1 month, becomes schizophreniform)
- **Resolution:** Complete return to pre-episode baseline

### Clinical Example from PDF (Lines 343-351):

**Case Description:**
- **Age/Context:** 24-year-old college student
- **Stressors:**
  - Heated argument with roommate
  - Failed two exams

**Psychotic Symptoms:**

- **Behavior:** Talking to herself
- **Behavior:** Screaming at "agents" in hallway
- **Affect:** Appears terrified
- **Sleep:** Barely sleeps for 5 days

**Duration:** 12 days

**Treatment:**
- Low-dose antipsychotic medication
- Supportive therapy

**Outcome:**
- Beliefs and hallucinations completely disappear
- Returns fully to baseline
- Good insight that episode was related to extreme stress

### Functioning Requirements
- **During episode:** Severe impairment (as illustrated by the example)
- **After episode:** FULL return to baseline functioning required
- **Key feature:** No residual symptoms

### Key Distinguishing Features
1. **vs Schizophreniform:** Much shorter duration (days/weeks vs months)
2. **vs Schizophrenia:** Complete recovery vs chronic course
3. **Stress relationship:** Often linked to identifiable stressor
4. **Prognosis:** Excellent - full recovery expected
5. **Timeline precision:** Must be <1 month; if symptoms persist ≥1 month, diagnosis changes

## 5. DELUSIONAL DISORDER

### Exact Diagnostic Criteria (Lines 353-397)
- **Duration:** ≥1 month
- **Core feature:** One or more delusions
- **Functioning:** Relatively normal functioning OTHERWISE (this is critical)
- **Key characteristic:** Delusions are NON-BIZARRE (could theoretically happen)

### Required Symptoms
**Primary:** One or more delusions lasting ≥1 month

**Exclusions (what is NOT present):**
- No prominent hallucinations (may have tactile/olfactory related to delusion)
- No disorganized speech
- No disorganized behavior
- No negative symptoms

- **Outside delusion:** Functioning is INTACT
- **Work:** Can maintain employment (accountant, bus driver examples)
- **Social:** Can have normal conversations
- **Appearance:** Appropriate (dresses normally)
- **No global impairment:** Unlike schizophrenia

### Key Distinguishing Features

## COMPARATIVE SUMMARY: Duration & Functioning Matrix

| Disorder | Duration | Functioning | Core Features |
|----------|----------|-------------|---------------|
| **Schizophrenia** | ≥6 months | Significant decline required | Full psychotic syndrome, chronic |
| **Schizophreniform** | 1-6 months | May be impaired; long-term impairment NOT required | Same symptoms as schizophrenia, shorter duration |
| **Schizoaffective** | Variable (typically chronic) | Impaired during episodes | Psychosis + mood episodes BOTH present |
| **Brief Psychotic** | 1 day to <1 month | Severe during episode; FULL recovery after | Sudden onset, stress-related, complete resolution |
| **Delusional** | ≥1 month | INTACT outside delusion | Only delusions, no other psychotic symptoms |

## CRITICAL DIAGNOSTIC DISTINCTIONS

### Duration Timeline:
```
1 day -----> <1 month -----> 1-6 months -----> ≥6 months
  |              |                |                  |
  Brief      Brief Psychotic  Schizophreniform  Schizophrenia
  onset         Disorder          Disorder
```

### Symptom Complexity:
- **Most symptoms:** Schizophrenia, Schizophreniform (full syndrome)
- **Symptoms + mood:** Schizoaffective (dual diagnosis)
- **Single symptom:** Delusional Disorder (only delusions)
- **Variable but recovers:** Brief Psychotic Disorder

### Functioning Level:
- **Best:** Delusional Disorder (intact outside delusion)
- **Variable:** Schizophreniform (may be impaired temporarily)
- **Worst:** Schizophrenia (significant decline required)

---

## KEY CONCEPTS FOR QUESTION CREATION

### Temporal Precision Questions:
- Why does 5 months of symptoms = schizophreniform but 7 months = schizophrenia?
- What happens to diagnosis if Brief Psychotic symptoms last 35 days?
- How long must delusions persist for Delusional Disorder diagnosis?

### Symptom Distinction Questions:
- What's the difference between hallucinations in schizophrenia vs brief psychotic disorder?
- Why can someone with Delusional Disorder work full-time but schizophrenia patients often cannot?
- What makes schizoaffective different from "schizophrenia with depression"?

### Clinical Reasoning Questions:
- Given the clanging example, what type of symptom is being demonstrated?
- If someone has persecutory delusions for 2 years but works normally, what diagnosis?
- Why is the college student's case Brief Psychotic and not Schizophreniform?

### Mechanism Questions:
- What is the cognitive mechanism behind "thought broadcasting" delusions?
- How do negative symptoms (flat affect) differ mechanistically from positive symptoms (delusions)?
- Why are auditory hallucinations more common than visual in schizophrenia?

### Tricky Distinctions:
- Schizoaffective vs Bipolar with psychotic features (timing of psychosis)
- Delusional Disorder erotomanic type vs normal infatuation
- Schizophreniform as transitional diagnosis to schizophrenia
