## SCHIZOPHRENIA SPECTRUM DISORDERS

### Clanging (Disorganized Speech)
**Source:** PSYCHOPATHOLOGY.txt, lines 310-318

**Full Dialogue Example:**
```
TH: 'What colour is your dress?'

TH: 'Why is a bed like being dead?'
CL: 'I dunno . . . maybe it's a med.'
TH: 'What's a med?'
CL: 'A bled.'
```

- Loss of logical connection between words

**Why it's useful:**

She is seen talking to herself, screaming at 'agents' in the hallway, and appears terrified. She barely sleeps for 5 days. After 12 days, with low-dose antipsychotic medication and supportive therapy, the beliefs and hallucinations completely disappear, and she returns fully to her baseline, with good insight that it was related to extreme stress."

## TREATMENT EXAMPLES

### Aversion Therapy: A Clockwork Orange
**Source:** TREATMENTS AND THERAPIES.txt, lines 257-275

**Full Description:**
"Malcolm McDowell in a scene from A Clockwork Orange. His eyes are clamped open, forcing him to watch a film portraying acts of violence and sadism, as part of aversion therapy. He'd earlier been given an emetic drug, so that extreme nausea and violence will become associated."

**What it demonstrates:**
- Classical conditioning to create aversion
- Pairing attractive stimulus (violence) with noxious stimulus (nausea from emetic drug)
- Physical restraint to ensure exposure (eyes clamped open)
- Goal: condition aversion to previously desired stimulus

**Mechanism:**
1. Patient given emetic drug (causes nausea)
2. While nauseous, forced to watch violence
3. Repeated pairing creates association
4. Eventually, violence alone triggers nausea/aversion

**Why it's useful:**
- Iconic film example students recognize
- Shows the MECHANISM clearly (pairing + conditioning)
- Demonstrates the ethical concerns (forced exposure)
- Concrete example of classical conditioning in therapy

**Application examples from text:**
- Alcohol (pair alcohol with nausea-inducing drug)
- Pedophiles (pair inappropriate stimuli with aversive stimulus)

### Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT): Social Anxiety Example
**Source:** TREATMENTS AND THERAPIES.txt, lines 223-236

**Full Example:**
"Someone with social anxiety is invited to a work party.

A (Activating Event): You arrive at the party and notice a group of colleagues talking, but no one immediately approaches you to chat.

B (Belief): 'They think I'm boring and awkward. Everyone here dislikes me, and I'll never fit in. This proves I'm unlikeable.'

C (Consequence):
- Emotional: Intense anxiety, embarrassment, or shame
- Behavioral: You leave the party early, avoid eye contact, or stand alone in a corner."

**What it demonstrates:**
- ABC model in action
- How thoughts (not events) cause emotional reactions
- Cognitive distortions: mind reading, overgeneralization, personalization
- How beliefs lead to maladaptive behaviors

**Why it's useful:**
- Relatable scenario (work party)
- Shows the CHAIN: event → thought → feeling → behavior
- Demonstrates how CBT targets the B (beliefs) to change C (consequences)
- Students can see how the same event with different beliefs would lead to different outcomes

## USAGE GUIDE FOR QUESTION WRITERS

**When writing explanations, reference these examples to:**
1. Make abstract concepts concrete
2. Give students memorable anchors
3. Show MECHANISMS not just symptoms
4. Provide real-world context

**Example transformation:**
- BEFORE: "Clanging is when speech follows rhyming patterns"
- AFTER: "Clanging is when speech follows sound associations instead of logic. For example, when asked 'What color is your dress?', a patient responds 'Red... like a bed' then 'Because it's dead' then 'maybe it's a med' then 'A bled' - connecting words by sound, not meaning."

**For ADHD-friendly explanations:**
- Use the FULL case examples (not summaries)
- Include specific behavioral details
- Show the timeline/sequence
- Explain the WHY (mechanism)
- Make connections to familiar references (celebrities, movies)
