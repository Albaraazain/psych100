**Agent:** researcher-schizophr-223534-76d6f7
**Task:** Extract ALL schizophrenia spectrum disorder details from PDF
**Status:** COMPLETE

---

## DELIVERABLES CREATED

**Purpose:** Comprehensive extraction of all 5 disorders
**Contents:**
- Exact diagnostic criteria for each disorder
- Complete symptom lists (positive/negative)
- 7 delusion types with definitions
- 7 clinical case examples verbatim from PDF
- Functioning requirements for each
- Comparative matrix (duration × functioning × symptoms)
- Clear distinctions between all disorders

**Key Data Points:**
- 5 disorders fully documented
- 7 clinical examples extracted
- 7 delusion types catalogued
- Clanging dialogue example included
- All temporal boundaries specified (1 day, 1 month, 6 months)

---

### 2. schizophrenia_question_themes.md
**Purpose:** Question creation framework for week10.json
**Contents:**
- 9 thematic question categories
- 15-18 question recommendation with mix
- Difficulty distribution (easy/medium/hard/tricky)
- ADHD-friendly explanation template
- Concrete examples for each theme
- Mechanism explanations for key concepts

**Question Themes:**
1. Duration-based differentiation (3 questions)
2. Functioning level distinctions (2 questions)
3. Symptom complexity (2-3 questions)
4. Delusion types (3 questions)
5. Schizoaffective distinction (2-3 questions)
6. Brief psychotic disorder (2 questions)
7. Hallucination specifics (1-2 questions)
8. Clanging example (1-2 questions)
9. Negative symptoms (2 questions)

---

## KEY INSIGHTS DISCOVERED

### Insight 1: Duration is Primary Differentiator
**Discovery:** The spectrum uses duration as the MAIN diagnostic criterion:
- 1 day to <1 month = Brief Psychotic Disorder
- 1-6 months = Schizophreniform Disorder
- ≥6 months = Schizophrenia
- ≥1 month (delusions only) = Delusional Disorder

**Implication:** Questions should emphasize temporal boundaries and "what happens at 6 months" concept.

---

### Insight 2: Functioning Level Separates Delusional Disorder
**Discovery:** Delusional disorder is unique because functioning is INTACT outside the delusion system. All 4 PDF examples showed:
- Full-time employment maintained (accountant, bus driver)
- Normal appearance and social interaction
- No global impairment

**Implication:** Strong contrast questions possible: "Why can delusional disorder patient work but schizophrenia patient cannot?"

---

### Insight 3: Schizoaffective is Diagnostically Complex
**Discovery:** Requires BOTH:
- Psychotic symptoms (even when mood is normal)
- Mood episodes (that meet full criteria)

**Distinction from similar diagnoses:**
- vs Schizophrenia: Must have mood episodes
- vs Bipolar with psychosis: Must have psychosis even WITHOUT mood episodes

**Implication:** This is a "tricky" question topic - requires deep understanding of temporal patterns.

---

### Insight 4: Clanging Example is Concrete Teaching Tool
**Discovery:** PDF provides complete dialogue demonstrating clanging:
```
TH: 'What colour is your dress?'
CL: 'Red . . . Like a bed.'
TH: 'Why is it like a bed?'
CL: 'Because it's dead.'
```

**Implication:** Can be used as stimulus for multiple questions:
- What symptom is this?
- Which category (positive/negative)?
- Which disorders show this?
- What's the mechanism?

---

### Insight 5: Seven Delusion Types Provide Rich Question Material
**Discovery:** PDF specifies 7 distinct delusion types with clear definitions:
1. Persecutory (most common)
2. Reference
3. Grandiose
4. Control
5. Thought (insertion/withdrawal/broadcasting)
6. Somatic
7. Nihilistic

**Implication:** 3+ questions possible just on delusion type identification from scenarios.

## COORDINATION WITH OTHER AGENTS

### Complementary Work Identified:

**researcher-clinical-223541-ee7882:**
- Created clinical_examples_catalog.md with 22 examples
- Includes schizophrenia spectrum examples
- **Coordination point:** My extraction provides detailed diagnostic criteria; their catalog provides broader clinical context

**researcher-current-e-223539-edc32f:**
- Identified ADHD-unfriendly patterns in current explanations

## RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATION PHASE

### For Question Creation (Builder Agents):

1. **Prioritize Duration Questions:** These are conceptually clearest and teach the fundamental structure of the spectrum.

2. **Use PDF Cases Verbatim:** The 7 case examples are excellent stimulus material - present case, ask diagnosis and reasoning.

3. **Emphasize Mechanisms:** Per ADHD-unfriendly analysis from other agents, every explanation should include WHY/HOW (provided in my templates).

4. **Create Difficulty Progression:** Start with easy definitional questions, build to tricky distinctions (schizoaffective temporal patterns).

5. **Visual Elements:** Use timelines and comparison charts in explanations (specified in ADHD template).

---

### For Explanation Rewriting:

1. **Use Provided Templates:** schizophrenia_question_themes.md contains complete ADHD-friendly explanation template.

2. **Include All 5 Elements:**
   - Concrete example
   - Visual/spatial element
   - Mechanism (why/how)
   - Anchor phrase
   - Distinction (what it's NOT)

3. **Mechanism Examples Provided:**
   - Negative symptoms: "Brain's reward/motivation circuits damaged"
   - Clanging: "Language center prioritizes sound over meaning"
   - Brief psychotic: "Stress overloads brain like circuit breaker"
