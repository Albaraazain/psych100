      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What is the primary mechanism of action for antipsychotic drugs?",
      "answer": "Decrease dopamine activity",
      "explanation": {
        "correct": "Antipsychotic drugs work by physically blocking dopamine D2 receptors in the brain. Here's what happens step-by-step:\n\n1. **Normal state:** Dopamine is released from sending neurons and binds to D2 receptors on receiving neurons\n2. **In psychosis:** There's excessive dopamine activity in the mesolimbic pathway (a specific brain circuit running from midbrain to limbic system)\n3. **What the drug does:** Antipsychotic molecules sit in the D2 receptor slots, physically preventing dopamine from binding\n4. **Result:** Even though dopamine is still being released, it can't activate receptors because the drug molecules are blocking the slots\n5. **Outcome:** Reduced dopamine signaling in the mesolimbic pathway → fewer hallucinations and delusions\n\n**Why positive symptoms improve but negative symptoms don't:** The drug blocks dopamine EVERYWHERE, not just where there's too much. In the prefrontal cortex (responsible for motivation, emotion), there may actually be TOO LITTLE dopamine. Blocking receptors there makes negative symptoms (flat affect, withdrawal) worse or unchanged.",
        "incorrect": {
          "Increase serotonin levels": "Wrong neurotransmitter for psychosis treatment. SSRIs increase serotonin for DEPRESSION, not psychosis. Antipsychotics target DOPAMINE receptors specifically. Some newer atypical antipsychotics do affect serotonin as a secondary effect, but the primary anti-hallucination effect comes from dopamine blocking.",
          "Block GABA receptors": "GABA is an inhibitory neurotransmitter that CALMS brain activity. Blocking GABA would INCREASE neural firing, which would make psychotic symptoms WORSE. Antianxiety drugs (benzodiazepines) ENHANCE GABA, not block it. Antipsychotics work on dopamine, not GABA.",
          "Enhance norepinephrine function": "Norepinephrine enhancement is the mechanism for certain antidepressants (tricyclics, SNRIs), not antipsychotics. Norepinephrine affects alertness and mood. Antipsychotics reduce dopamine activity specifically because excessive dopamine in certain brain pathways causes hallucinations and delusions."

      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "Which class of antidepressants is associated with milder side effects and more rapid symptom reduction?",
      "answer": "SSRIs",
      "explanation": {
        "correct": "SSRIs (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors) became first-line depression treatments because they work like this:\n\n**How SSRIs work:**\n1. Serotonin is released from neuron A into the synapse (gap between neurons)\n2. Some serotonin binds to receptors on neuron B (the receiving neuron)\n3. A reuptake pump (SERT transporter) on neuron A normally vacuums serotonin back for recycling\n4. SSRIs BLOCK this reuptake pump\n5. Result: Serotonin stays in the synapse longer → more receptor activation on neuron B\n\n**Why milder side effects:** SSRIs ONLY block serotonin reuptake. Older antidepressants (tricyclics, MAOIs) affect MULTIPLE neurotransmitter systems, causing more side effects. SSRIs are \"selective\" - they target one system.\n\n**Examples:** Prozac (fluoxetine), Zoloft (sertraline), Lexapro (escitalopram)\n\n**Timeline:** Takes 2-4 weeks for full effect because the brain needs time to adjust receptor sensitivity.",
        "incorrect": {
          "Tricyclics": "Tricyclics are an OLDER class with MORE side effects, not fewer. They block reuptake of MULTIPLE neurotransmitters (serotonin, norepinephrine, AND histamine). The histamine blocking causes drowsiness, dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation, and weight gain. They also affect heart rhythm. SSRIs are safer and better tolerated.",
          "MAO inhibitors": "MAO inhibitors have the MOST SEVERE side effects of any antidepressant class. They block the MAO enzyme that breaks down multiple neurotransmitters. The dangerous problem: tyramine in foods (aged cheese, wine, fermented foods) isn't broken down properly, causing potentially fatal spikes in blood pressure (hypertensive crisis). Patients must follow strict dietary restrictions. Used only when other treatments fail.",
          "Lithium compounds": "Lithium is NOT an antidepressant at all - it's a mood STABILIZER used for bipolar disorder. It prevents both manic highs and depressive lows. Lithium has a very narrow therapeutic window (the effective dose is close to the toxic dose), requiring regular blood tests to monitor levels. Different medication class entirely."

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "A major criticism of drug treatments for psychological disorders is that they:",
      "answer": "Do not teach coping and problem-solving skills",
      "explanation": {
        "correct": "Here's the core limitation: medications can change brain chemistry but cannot teach you skills.\n\n**What medications CAN do:**\n- Reduce symptom intensity (less anxiety, improved mood)\n- Stabilize brain chemistry temporarily\n- Make therapy more effective by reducing symptoms enough to participate\n\n**What medications CANNOT do:**\n- Teach you how to challenge negative thoughts\n- Help you practice facing feared situations\n- Give you strategies for managing stress\n- Change your thinking patterns or behavioral habits\n- Provide coping skills for when you stop taking the medication\n\n**The consequence:** When medications are stopped, symptoms often return because nothing changed about how the person thinks, copes, or behaves. The underlying patterns remain.\n\n**This is why combination treatment (medication + therapy) often works best:** Medication reduces symptoms enough to function, while therapy builds lasting skills.",
        "incorrect": {
          "Always cure the underlying disorder": "This is backwards - it states a STRENGTH that medications actually DON'T have. Medications do NOT cure disorders; they MANAGE symptoms. When you stop taking antidepressants, depression can return. When you stop taking antipsychotics, psychotic symptoms can return. This IS a valid criticism (not something drugs accomplish).",
          "Have no side effects": "All psychiatric medications have side effects - that's another valid criticism, not something positive. SSRIs can cause sexual dysfunction, weight changes, and sleep problems. Antipsychotics can cause movement disorders. Benzodiazepines cause dependence. Having side effects is a criticism OF drugs, not a criticism that drugs lack.",
          "Work immediately for all patients": "This describes something medications DON'T do - they DON'T work immediately or for everyone. Antidepressants take 2-4 weeks; many patients try multiple medications before finding one that works. If medications DID work immediately for everyone, that would be a STRENGTH, not a criticism."

      "question_number": 4,
      "question": "What is the primary goal of psychodynamic therapy?",
      "answer": "To achieve insight into unconscious conflicts",
      "explanation": {
        "correct": "Psychodynamic therapy is based on this core idea: thoughts, memories, and conflicts you're NOT consciously aware of are still affecting your current behavior and emotions.\n\n**What 'insight' actually means:**\n- Becoming consciously aware of patterns you didn't know were affecting you\n- Understanding connections between past experiences and current problems\n- Recognizing your defense mechanisms and why you use them\n\n**How the therapist helps achieve insight:**\n1. Uses techniques like free association (say whatever comes to mind) and dream interpretation\n2. Notices patterns in what the client talks about repeatedly\n3. Points out connections: \"You mention fear of disappointing your father a lot. I notice you also feel anxious about disappointing your boss. Could these be connected?\"\n\n**The theory:** Once you're AWARE of unconscious patterns, you have CHOICE. You can consciously decide to respond differently instead of automatically repeating old patterns.",
        "incorrect": {
          "To change automatic thoughts": "This is the goal of COGNITIVE therapy (Beck, CBT), NOT psychodynamic therapy. Cognitive therapy targets conscious thoughts that you can identify and examine. Psychodynamic therapy targets UNCONSCIOUS material - things you're not even aware of until therapy reveals them. Different therapeutic approach with different targets.",
          "To unlearn maladaptive behaviors": "This is the goal of BEHAVIOR therapy, which uses conditioning principles (exposure, reinforcement) to change learned behaviors. Behaviorists don't explore unconscious material at all - they focus on observable behavior. Psychodynamic therapy is insight-oriented, not behavior-focused.",
          "To develop unconditional positive regard": "Unconditional positive regard is what the THERAPIST provides in Carl Rogers' HUMANISTIC/person-centered therapy - not the client's goal. In humanistic therapy, the therapist accepts the client without judgment. In psychodynamic therapy, the focus is on uncovering unconscious conflicts through interpretation."

      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "In psychodynamic therapy, free association involves:",
      "answer": "The client reporting thoughts without censorship",
      "explanation": {
        "correct": "Free association is a specific technique where the client says WHATEVER comes to mind without filtering, editing, or judging their thoughts.\n\n**What this looks like in practice:**\n- Client lies on a couch or sits comfortably\n- Therapist says: \"Tell me whatever comes to mind, no matter how silly, embarrassing, or random it seems\"\n- Client speaks continuously: \"I'm thinking about work... that reminds me of my mother... she always criticized my report cards... I feel that same anxiety now when my boss reviews my work...\"\n\n**Why it works:**\n- When you DON'T censor, unconscious material slips through\n- Normally, we filter thoughts before speaking\n- The unfiltered stream reveals patterns, fears, memories, and associations that are hidden when we're careful about what we say\n\n**What the therapist does:**\n- Listens for recurring themes (same fears, relationships, conflicts appearing repeatedly)\n- Notes what topics the client avoids or stumbles on\n- Interprets connections between seemingly random thoughts",
        "incorrect": {
          "The client joining a support group without cost": "This misinterprets 'free' as 'no cost' instead of 'unrestricted.' Free association has nothing to do with support groups or payment. The 'free' means thoughts flow freely without being filtered or censored by the client.",
          "The therapist freely interpreting the client's dreams": "Dream interpretation IS a psychodynamic technique, but this describes what the THERAPIST does, not what free association means. Free association is what the CLIENT does - speaking without censorship. Interpretation is separate from free association.",
          "The client freely choosing their treatment goals": "This describes client autonomy in treatment planning, not free association. Free association is a specific technique during therapy sessions where the client reports thoughts as they arise without filtering them. Goal-setting is a different process."

      "question_number": 6,
      "question": "According to Carl Rogers, which is NOT one of the three essential therapist attributes in person-centered therapy?",
      "answer": "Interpretation of unconscious conflicts",
      "explanation": {
        "correct": "Interpreting unconscious conflicts is what PSYCHODYNAMIC therapists do, not humanistic therapists like Carl Rogers.\n\n**Rogers' actual three core conditions:**\n\n1. **Unconditional Positive Regard:** Accept the client completely, no matter what they say or do. Don't judge, evaluate, or show disapproval. The client is valued as a person even when describing behaviors the therapist might personally disagree with.\n\n2. **Empathy:** Understand the client's experience from THEIR perspective. Not just \"I understand you're upset\" but truly seeing the world through their eyes and communicating that understanding back.\n\n3. **Genuineness (Congruence):** The therapist is authentic and real, not hiding behind a professional mask. If the therapist is confused, they might say so. Their inner experience matches their outward behavior.\n\n**Why Rogers rejected interpretation:**\nRogers believed clients have their OWN capacity for growth and self-understanding. The therapist's job is to CREATE CONDITIONS for this growth (acceptance, understanding, authenticity) - not to be an expert who tells clients what's \"really\" going on in their unconscious.",
        "incorrect": {
          "Unconditional positive regard": "This IS one of Rogers' three core conditions. The therapist shows genuine acceptance without judgment or conditions attached. The client doesn't have to earn the therapist's regard by being a 'good' client or changing. This creates safety for honest self-exploration.",
          "Empathy": "This IS one of Rogers' three core conditions. The therapist actively works to understand and communicate understanding of the client's subjective experience - how the world looks and feels from the client's point of view.",
          "Genuineness": "This IS one of Rogers' three core conditions (also called congruence). The therapist is real, authentic, and transparent rather than playing a role or hiding behind professional distance. The therapist's words match their actual feelings."

      "question": "In Albert Ellis's REBT, the 'B' in the ABCD model represents:",
      "answer": "Belief system about the activating event",
      "explanation": {
        "correct": "Ellis's ABCD model shows that BELIEFS cause emotional reactions, not the events themselves.\n\n**The complete model:**\n\n**A - Activating Event:** Something happens (you fail an exam, someone criticizes you)\n\n**B - Belief:** What you THINK about the event. This is where irrational beliefs operate:\n- \"I MUST be perfect\"\n- \"Everyone MUST approve of me\"\n- \"Things SHOULD always go my way\"\n- \"It's TERRIBLE when they don't\"\n\n**C - Consequence:** Emotional and behavioral results (depression, anxiety, avoidance)\n\n**D - Disputing:** The therapist actively ARGUES against irrational beliefs: \"Why MUST everyone approve of you? Where is that written? What's the evidence that you can't survive disapproval?\"\n\n**Ellis's key insight:**\nTwo people can experience the same event (A) but have completely different emotional consequences (C) because they have different beliefs (B). Change the belief, change the emotion. This is why therapy targets B, not A - you can't always control events, but you can change your thinking about them.",
        "incorrect": {
          "Behavior that results from emotions": "Behavior is part of C (Consequences), not B. The consequences include both EMOTIONAL reactions (feeling anxious, depressed) and BEHAVIORAL reactions (avoiding situations, withdrawing). B specifically refers to the COGNITIVE component - beliefs and interpretations.",
          "Biological factors in mental disorders": "REBT is a cognitive therapy focused entirely on thoughts and beliefs, not biology. While biology plays a role in mental health, that's not what Ellis's B represents. The B is about how you INTERPRET events - your belief system, not your brain chemistry.",
          "Benefits of rational thinking": "While developing rational thinking IS the goal of REBT, that's not what B stands for. B represents the beliefs (both irrational AND rational) that a person holds. The therapy aims to replace irrational B with rational B, but B itself just means 'Belief.'"

      "question": "Aaron Beck's cognitive therapy for depression focuses on identifying and changing:",
      "answer": "Negative automatic thoughts",
      "explanation": {
        "correct": "Beck discovered that depressed people have a pattern of automatic negative thoughts that pop up rapidly and feel completely true.\n\n**What 'automatic' means:**\n- These thoughts happen WITHOUT conscious effort\n- They're like reflexes - they just appear\n- They feel like facts, not opinions\n- Example: When you make a small mistake, the thought \"I'm such an idiot\" pops up automatically\n\n**Beck's Negative Triad - three interlocking negative views:**\n1. **Negative view of SELF:** \"I am worthless, inadequate, unlovable\"\n2. **Negative view of WORLD:** \"Everything is hopeless, people are hostile, nothing works out\"\n3. **Negative view of FUTURE:** \"Things will never improve, I'll always fail, there's no point trying\"\n\n**How cognitive therapy works:**\n1. Client learns to CATCH the automatic thoughts (write them down when they happen)\n2. Client EXAMINES evidence for and against the thought: \"Is it TRUE that I'm worthless? What's the actual evidence?\"\n3. Client develops more BALANCED thoughts: \"I made a mistake. That doesn't mean I'm worthless. I've succeeded at many things.\"\n\n**These thoughts are NOT unconscious** (unlike psychodynamic material). They're just automatic and unexamined until therapy teaches you to notice them.",
        "incorrect": {
          "Unconscious defense mechanisms": "Defense mechanisms are PSYCHODYNAMIC concepts, not cognitive therapy concepts. Beck focuses on thoughts that ARE accessible to consciousness once you learn to notice them. You can identify 'I'm worthless' as a thought you're having. Truly unconscious material (in the Freudian sense) isn't directly accessible.",
          "Conditioned fear responses": "Conditioned fear responses are targets of BEHAVIOR therapy, particularly exposure therapy for phobias. Behaviorists focus on learned associations (classical conditioning) and learned behaviors (operant conditioning). Beck's cognitive therapy targets THOUGHTS, not conditioned responses.",
          "Dopamine receptor activity": "Dopamine is a biological target for MEDICATION (antipsychotics block dopamine receptors). Beck's therapy is purely psychological - it changes how people think through talk therapy, not how their brain chemistry works. Cognitive therapy = changing thoughts. Medication = changing brain chemistry."

      "question": "A person with social anxiety thinks 'Everyone at the party thinks I'm boring' when no one approaches them immediately. In CBT, this would be considered:",
      "answer": "A distorted belief to be challenged",
      "explanation": {
        "correct": "This thought contains multiple cognitive distortions that CBT would identify and challenge:\n\n**Cognitive distortions in this thought:**\n1. **Mind reading:** Assuming you know what others think (\"They think I'm boring\") without evidence\n2. **Overgeneralization:** \"EVERYONE\" - all-or-nothing thinking\n3. **Jumping to conclusions:** Interpreting no immediate approach as rejection\n\n**How CBT would challenge this:**\n\n**Therapist:** \"What's the evidence that everyone thinks you're boring?\"\n\n**Client might realize:** \"I don't actually know what they think. They're already in conversation. Maybe they didn't see me come in. Maybe they're shy too.\"\n\n**More balanced thought:** \"Some people are already talking. I could join a conversation or wait a few minutes. One person not approaching me doesn't mean everyone dislikes me.\"\n\n**The key insight:** The THOUGHT ('everyone thinks I'm boring') caused the anxiety and early departure, not the situation itself. Someone with different thoughts about the same situation (people talking when they arrive) would feel and behave differently.",
        "incorrect": {
          "An accurate assessment requiring acceptance": "CBT does NOT accept distorted thoughts as accurate. This thought involves cognitive errors (mind reading, overgeneralization). The goal is to CHALLENGE and MODIFY inaccurate beliefs, not accept them. Accepting 'everyone thinks I'm boring' would maintain the anxiety and avoidance.",
          "An unconscious defense mechanism": "Defense mechanisms are PSYCHODYNAMIC concepts. This thought is CONSCIOUS - the person is aware they're having it (that's how they can report it). It's automatic and habitual, but not unconscious. CBT deals with accessible thoughts, not hidden unconscious material.",
          "A conditioned stimulus for anxiety": "A conditioned stimulus (CS) is a classical conditioning concept from BEHAVIOR therapy. In conditioning terms, the CS is an external stimulus (like a bell, or maybe the party itself). The THOUGHT is not a conditioned stimulus - it's a cognitive interpretation of the situation. CBT views thoughts as mediators between situations and emotions."

      "question_number": 10,
      "question": "Behavior therapy differs from other approaches by viewing psychological problems as:",
      "answer": "The learned behaviors themselves",
      "explanation": {
        "correct": "Behaviorists make a radical claim: the behaviors ARE the problem, not symptoms of something deeper.\n\n**The behavioral view:**\n- Problem behaviors (phobias, addictions, aggression) were LEARNED\n- They were learned through classical conditioning (associations) or operant conditioning (reinforcement/punishment) or observational learning (watching others)\n- If they were LEARNED, they can be UNLEARNED using the same principles\n- No need to dig for unconscious causes or childhood trauma\n- Directly target the behavior that's causing problems\n\n**Example - Phobia of dogs:**\n- Psychodynamic view: Fear of dogs is a SYMPTOM of unconscious conflict (maybe symbolizes a threatening father figure)\n- Behavioral view: Fear of dogs IS the problem. It was learned (maybe bitten as a child). It can be unlearned through exposure therapy\n\n**Why this matters for treatment:**\n- No need for insight into unconscious\n- No need to change thoughts (though CBT adds this)\n- Just use conditioning principles to change the behavior directly\n- Faster, more focused treatment",
        "incorrect": {
          "Symptoms of underlying unconscious conflicts": "This is the PSYCHODYNAMIC view, not behavioral. Psychodynamic therapists believe surface behaviors are symptoms of deeper unconscious issues. Behaviorists explicitly REJECT this - they say the behavior itself is the problem, with no hidden cause that needs uncovering.",
          "Results of irrational belief systems": "This is the COGNITIVE therapy view (Ellis and Beck). Cognitive therapists focus on faulty thinking patterns. While CBT combines cognitive and behavioral approaches, PURE behavior therapy focuses on learned behaviors and conditioning, not belief systems.",
          "Chemical imbalances in the brain": "This is the BIOLOGICAL/medical model view, which leads to treatment with medication. Behavior therapy is purely psychological - it explains problems through learning history (conditioning experiences), not brain chemistry. Different theoretical framework entirely."

      "question_number": 11,
      "question": "Systematic desensitization treats phobias by:",
      "answer": "Gradual exposure paired with relaxation techniques",
      "explanation": {
        "correct": "Systematic desensitization is a step-by-step process that pairs anxiety-provoking situations with relaxation.\n\n**The process:**\n\n**Step 1 - Learn relaxation:** Patient learns deep muscle relaxation or controlled breathing\n\n**Step 2 - Create fear hierarchy:** A ranked list from LEAST to MOST scary:\n1. Looking at a picture of a spider (low anxiety)\n2. Watching a video of a spider (medium anxiety)\n3. Being in a room with a spider in a cage (higher anxiety)\n4. Having a spider near you (high anxiety)\n5. Holding a spider (maximum anxiety)\n\n**Step 3 - Gradual exposure with relaxation:**\n- Start at Level 1 (picture of spider)\n- Practice relaxation while looking at picture\n- Body can't be relaxed AND anxious at the same time (reciprocal inhibition)\n- Stay until anxiety drops\n- Move to Level 2 only when Level 1 causes no anxiety\n- Repeat all the way up the hierarchy\n\n**Why it works (the mechanism):**\nThe brain learns a new association: spider = relaxation, not spider = panic. This is called counterconditioning - replacing one learned response with an opposite one.",
        "incorrect": {
          "Immediate intense exposure to the most feared situation": "This describes FLOODING, not systematic desensitization. Flooding skips the gradual hierarchy and exposes the patient immediately to maximum fear (e.g., room full of spiders). Flooding is faster but more distressing. Systematic desensitization is GRADUAL and uses RELAXATION - two key differences from flooding.",
          "Pairing the feared stimulus with a noxious stimulus": "This describes AVERSION therapy, which is used for the OPPOSITE problem - when someone is attracted to something harmful (like alcohol). Aversion therapy creates avoidance of something attractive. Systematic desensitization creates comfort with something feared. Opposite goals.",
          "Analyzing the unconscious meaning of the fear": "This is a PSYCHODYNAMIC approach. Behaviorists don't interpret unconscious meaning - they view the phobia as a learned response that can be unlearned. Systematic desensitization uses conditioning principles (counterconditioning), not insight or interpretation."

      "question": "Aversion therapy for alcohol abuse would involve:",
      "answer": "Pairing alcohol consumption with a nausea-inducing drug",
      "explanation": {
        "correct": "Aversion therapy uses classical conditioning to make something attractive become disgusting.\n\n**How it works for alcohol abuse:**\n\n1. **Give the person a drug that causes nausea** (like Antabuse/disulfiram or an emetic)\n2. **Have them drink alcohol while nauseous**\n3. **Repeat this pairing multiple times**\n\n**The conditioning process:**\n- Alcohol (previously pleasant) = Conditioned Stimulus (CS)\n- Nausea drug effect = Unconditioned Stimulus (UCS)\n- Nausea/vomiting = Unconditioned Response (UCR)\n- After pairing: Alcohol alone → Nausea = Conditioned Response (CR)\n\n**Cultural example - A Clockwork Orange:**\nIn this film, a violent criminal is given an emetic drug, then forced to watch violence (eyes clamped open). After repeated pairings, violence triggers nausea. The film shows both the mechanism and the ethical concerns.\n\n**Limitations:**\n- Works best when combined with other treatments that teach alternative coping\n- The person might learn that alcohol PLUS that drug causes nausea, but alcohol without the drug might still be appealing\n- Ethical concerns about using punishment/discomfort",
        "incorrect": {
          "Gradually exposing the person to alcohol in safe settings": "This sounds like exposure therapy, which is for PHOBIAS (reducing fear of something). Alcohol abuse is the OPPOSITE problem - the person is attracted to alcohol when they shouldn't be. You'd use exposure for fear, aversion for unwanted attraction.",
          "Teaching the person to challenge irrational beliefs about drinking": "This describes COGNITIVE therapy, which targets thoughts and beliefs. Aversion therapy is BEHAVIORAL - it works through conditioning, not through changing beliefs. A cognitive approach might examine beliefs like 'I need alcohol to relax,' but that's different from conditioning disgust.",
          "Exploring childhood experiences related to alcohol": "This is a PSYCHODYNAMIC approach - exploring past experiences to gain insight. Aversion therapy doesn't explore the past or seek insight. It simply pairs alcohol with something unpleasant to condition avoidance. No interpretation or exploration of origins."

      "question": "A token economy works through the principle of:",
      "answer": "Operant conditioning with positive reinforcement",
      "explanation": {
        "correct": "A token economy is a behavior modification system based on B.F. Skinner's operant conditioning principles.\n\n**How it works:**\n\n1. **Identify target behaviors:** What behaviors do you want to increase? (completing hygiene tasks, participating in therapy, following rules)\n\n2. **Give tokens IMMEDIATELY after desired behavior:** Poker chips, points, stickers, checkmarks - something that can be accumulated\n\n3. **Tokens are exchangeable:** Later, tokens can be traded for actual rewards (TV time, special snacks, privileges, activities)\n\n**Why tokens work:**\n- IMMEDIACY: Behavior is reinforced right away, even if the actual reward comes later\n- Tokens bridge the gap between behavior and delayed reward\n- Clear, consistent rules\n- Works across many settings (psychiatric hospitals, schools, prisons, homes)\n\n**The operant conditioning principle:**\n- Positive reinforcement = Adding something pleasant (the token) after a behavior\n- This INCREASES the likelihood of that behavior happening again\n- Token is a secondary reinforcer (learned value) that can be exchanged for primary reinforcers (food, activities with natural value)",
        "incorrect": {
          "Classical conditioning with paired stimuli": "Classical conditioning involves pairing stimuli to create associations (like Pavlov's bell + food). Token economies don't pair stimuli - they provide CONSEQUENCES for behavior. When you do X, you receive Y. That's operant conditioning (consequences), not classical conditioning (associations).",
          "Cognitive restructuring of automatic thoughts": "Cognitive restructuring is a COGNITIVE therapy technique for changing thoughts. Token economies are purely BEHAVIORAL - they don't address thoughts or beliefs at all. The focus is entirely on observable behaviors and their consequences (reinforcement).",
          "Insight into unconscious motivations": "Insight is the goal of PSYCHODYNAMIC therapy. Token economies are behavioral interventions that don't explore unconscious material. There's no interpretation, no exploration of why behaviors developed - just systematic reinforcement of desired behaviors."

      "answer": "Psychodynamic therapy",
      "explanation": {
        "correct": "Dream interpretation is a core psychodynamic technique because Freud called dreams 'the royal road to the unconscious.'\n\n**Psychodynamic view of dreams:**\n- Dreams express unconscious wishes, fears, and conflicts\n- The dream content is symbolic - it represents something else\n- Example: Dreaming of drowning might symbolize feeling overwhelmed by emotions or responsibilities\n- The therapist helps decode the symbols to reveal hidden meanings\n\n**How dream interpretation works:**\n1.

Patient is given anesthesia (unconscious) and a muscle relaxant (prevents convulsions from causing injury)\n2. Electrodes placed on scalp\n3. Brief electrical current (less than 1 second) passes through brain\n4. This induces a controlled seizure in the central nervous system (about 30-60 seconds)\n5. Patient wakes up, typically with temporary confusion\n\n**Why ECT is used for severe depression with suicide risk:**\n- **Speed:** Effects can be IMMEDIATE - within days. Medications take 2-4 WEEKS\n- **When waiting is dangerous:** A suicidal patient can't safely wait weeks for medication to work\n- **When medications fail:** ECT is tried after multiple medications haven't worked\n\n**The mechanism is unknown:**\nWe know ECT works for severe depression, but we don't know exactly WHY inducing a seizure helps.

So while they help positive symptoms (by reducing excess dopamine in mesolimbic pathway), they may worsen negative symptoms (by further reducing already-low dopamine in prefrontal cortex).\n\n**This is why schizophrenia is hard to treat:**\nYou need to reduce dopamine in one area while possibly increasing it in another - current drugs can't do that.",

You can't always control external events (A)\n2. Trying to directly change emotions (C) doesn't work\n3. But changing BELIEFS about events can change emotions\n4. Beliefs are learned and can be unlearned\n\n**The disputation process:**\n- Irrational B: \"I MUST be perfect; failure is CATASTROPHIC\"\n- Therapist disputes: \"Why MUST you be perfect? Where is that law written?\"\n- Rational B: \"I'd PREFER success, but failure is disappointing, not catastrophic\"\n- New C: Disappointment instead of devastation",
        "incorrect": {
          "A (the activating events that trigger reactions)": "We often CAN'T control external events. Getting fired, someone dying, failing an exam - these happen. Ellis's point is that we can't always change A, but we CAN change how we interpret it (B). Targeting A would often be impossible.",
          "C (the emotional and behavioral consequences)": "C is the RESULT, not the cause. If you try to change C directly (\"just stop feeling anxious!\"), it doesn't work because you haven't addressed the beliefs causing the anxiety. Change B, and C follows.",
          "The unconscious conflicts underlying all three": "Ellis explicitly rejected psychodynamic concepts. REBT is purely COGNITIVE - it deals with beliefs that are accessible to consciousness, not hidden unconscious material. The beliefs may be automatic, but they're not unconscious in the Freudian sense."
