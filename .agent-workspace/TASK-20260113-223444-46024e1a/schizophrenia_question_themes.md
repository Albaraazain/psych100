## QUESTION THEMES FOR WEEK 10 JSON

### Theme 1: DURATION-BASED DIFFERENTIATION (High Priority)

**Concept:** Duration is the PRIMARY diagnostic differentiator in spectrum

**Question Types:**
1. **Timeline Questions:**
   - "A patient has psychotic symptoms for 4 months. Which diagnosis?" (Answer: Schizophreniform)
   - "Symptoms began 8 months ago and persist. Which diagnosis?" (Answer: Schizophrenia)
   - "Delusions present for 3 weeks, then resolved. Which diagnosis?" (Answer: Brief Psychotic)

2. **Boundary Questions (Tricky):**
   - "What happens to diagnosis if Brief Psychotic symptoms last exactly 30 days?" (Answer: Still Brief Psychotic; must be <1 month)
   - "Patient has symptoms for 5.5 months - schizophreniform or schizophrenia?" (Answer: Schizophreniform; not yet 6 months)

3. **Progression Questions:**
   - "Schizophreniform can progress to what disorder?" (Answer: Schizophrenia if symptoms persist >6 months)

**ADHD-Friendly Explanation Style:**
- Use visual timeline: "1 day → <1 month → 1-6 months → ≥6 months"
- Concrete anchors: "4 months = schizophreniform, 8 months = schizophrenia"
- Mechanism: "Why 6 months? Marks transition from acute to chronic brain changes"

---

### Theme 2: FUNCTIONING LEVEL DISTINCTIONS (High Priority)

**Concept:** Functioning separates delusional disorder from others

**Question Types:**
1. **Delusional Disorder Identification:**
   - "Patient works full-time, dresses normally, but believes FBI monitors them. Diagnosis?" (Answer: Delusional disorder - functioning intact)
   - "Why can someone with delusional disorder work as bus driver but schizophrenia patient cannot?" (Answer: Impairment only within delusion system vs global decline)

2. **Comparison Questions:**
   - "Compare functioning in schizophrenia vs delusional disorder" (Answer: Significant decline vs intact outside delusion)
   - "Which requires 'significant functional decline' for diagnosis?" (Answer: Schizophrenia)

3. **Case-Based:**
   - Use the 58-year-old bus driver case (persecutory delusions + aluminum foil but works daily)
   - Use the 45-year-old accountant case (erotomanic delusions but full-time work)

**ADHD-Friendly Explanation Style:**
- Concrete comparison: "Delusional = works, socializes, normal life EXCEPT the one belief; Schizophrenia = can't work, withdrawn, global problems"
- Mechanism: "Delusional disorder affects ONLY belief system; schizophrenia disrupts entire cognitive/emotional processing"

---

### Theme 3: SYMPTOM COMPLEXITY (Medium Priority)

**Concept:** Number and types of symptoms vary across disorders

**Question Types:**
1. **Symptom Count:**
   - "Which disorder has ONLY delusions, no other psychotic symptoms?" (Answer: Delusional disorder)
   - "Which disorders can have full psychotic syndrome?" (Answer: Schizophrenia, schizophreniform, brief psychotic)

2. **Positive vs Negative:**
   - "What are negative symptoms in schizophrenia?" (Answer: Flat/blunt affect, avolition, alogia)
   - "Does delusional disorder include negative symptoms?" (Answer: No)

3. **Specific Symptoms:**
   - "What is 'clanging'?" (Answer: Nonsensical rhyming speech pattern)
   - Use the actual dialogue from PDF as question stimulus

**ADHD-Friendly Explanation Style:**
- Visual breakdown: "Schizophrenia = delusions + hallucinations + disorganized speech + negative symptoms; Delusional = ONLY delusions"
- Mechanism for negative symptoms: "Brain's reward/motivation circuits damaged → can't feel pleasure or initiate action"

---

### Theme 4: DELUSION TYPES (Medium-High Priority)

**Concept:** 7 specific delusion types with distinct content

**Question Types:**
1. **Type Identification:**
   - "Patient believes thoughts are being removed from mind. Which delusion type?" (Answer: Thought withdrawal)
   - "Patient believes TV news contains special messages for them. Which type?" (Answer: Delusions of reference)
   - "Patient believes they're a secret royal. Which type?" (Answer: Grandiose)

2. **Multiple Choice with Cases:**
   - Present the 38-year-old parasite case → "What type of delusion?" (Answer: Somatic)
   - Present the 50-year-old jealous husband → "What type?" (Answer: Jealous)

3. **Tricky Distinctions:**
   - "Persecutory vs delusions of control" (Answer: Being harmed by others vs external forces controlling you)
   - "Grandiose vs erotomanic" (Answer: I'm special/powerful vs someone special loves me)

**ADHD-Friendly Explanation Style:**
- Categories with examples:
  - Persecutory = "They're out to get me" (FBI, neighbors)
  - Reference = "That's about ME" (TV, songs)
  - Grandiose = "I'm secretly amazing" (royalty, genius)
  - Control = "They control my thoughts/actions"
  - Somatic = "My body has X wrong" (parasites, disease)
  - Nihilistic = "Nothing is real" (world ended)
  - Erotomanic = "Celebrity loves me"

---

### Theme 5: SCHIZOAFFECTIVE DISTINCTION (High Priority - Tricky)

**Concept:** Requires BOTH psychosis AND mood episodes

**Question Types:**
1. **Diagnostic Criteria:**
   - "What makes schizoaffective different from schizophrenia?" (Answer: Presence of mood episodes)
   - "Can someone have schizophrenia with depression?" (Answer: Yes, but schizoaffective requires mood EPISODES that meet full criteria)

2. **Case-Based:**
   - Use the 28-year-old case with hallucinations + delusions + depressive episodes + elevated mood

3. **Temporal Patterns (Very Tricky):**
   - "What's the difference between schizoaffective and bipolar with psychotic features?" (Answer: Schizoaffective has psychosis even WITHOUT mood episodes; bipolar only has psychosis DURING mood episodes)

**ADHD-Friendly Explanation Style:**
- Timeline diagram:
  ```
  Schizoaffective: [Psychosis always present] + [Mood episodes come and go]
  Bipolar w/ psychosis: [Psychosis ONLY during mood episodes]
  Schizophrenia: [Psychosis] [No mood episodes]
  ```
- Mechanism: "Two separate brain system problems: thought processing (psychosis) + mood regulation (depression/mania)"

---

### Theme 6: BRIEF PSYCHOTIC DISORDER (Medium Priority)

**Concept:** Stress-triggered, short-lived, complete recovery

**Question Types:**
1. **Case Identification:**
   - Present the 24-year-old college student case → multiple questions:
     - "What was the trigger?" (Exams + argument)
     - "How long did it last?" (12 days)
     - "What was the outcome?" (Complete recovery)

2. **Prognosis Questions:**
   - "Which disorder has best prognosis?" (Answer: Brief psychotic - full recovery)
   - "What indicates brief psychotic vs schizophreniform?" (Answer: Full return to baseline + duration <1 month)

3. **Stressor Relationship:**
   - "Is stress required for brief psychotic disorder?" (Answer: Often present but not required)

**ADHD-Friendly Explanation Style:**
- Story format: "Student under extreme stress → brain's stress response overloads → temporary psychosis (like circuit breaker) → resets with treatment"
- Concrete: "Think of it like a psychological 'fever' - intense but temporary response to overwhelming situation"

---

### Theme 7: HALLUCINATION SPECIFICS (Low-Medium Priority)

**Concept:** Auditory hallucinations most common in schizophrenia

**Question Types:**
1. **Type Questions:**
   - "What type of hallucination is MOST common in schizophrenia?" (Answer: Auditory)
   - "What makes hallucinations different from illusions?" (Answer: Hallucinations have no external stimulus)

2. **Clinical Characteristics:**
   - "What does 'compelling sense of reality' mean?" (Answer: Person experiences hallucination as real, not imagined)

**ADHD-Friendly Explanation Style:**
- Mechanism: "Brain's auditory processing areas activate WITHOUT external sound → person hears voices that aren't there"
- Comparison: "Like hearing your name called when no one did - but constant and elaborate"

---

### Theme 8: CLANGING EXAMPLE (High Priority - Informative)

**Concept:** Disorganized speech pattern with rhyming

**Question Types:**
1. **Definition:**
   - "What is clanging?" (Answer: Nonsensical rhyming speech pattern)

2. **Recognition:**
   - Present the actual dialogue from PDF → "What symptom is demonstrated?"

3. **Symptom Category:**
   - "Is clanging a positive or negative symptom?" (Answer: Positive - disorganized speech)
   - "Which disorder shows clanging?" (Answer: Schizophrenia, schizophreniform - any with disorganized speech)

**ADHD-Friendly Explanation Style:**
- Use actual example from PDF
- Mechanism: "Brain's language center prioritizes sound/rhyme over meaning → words chosen by how they sound, not what they mean"
- Concrete: "Like poetry mode stuck ON when trying to have normal conversation"

---

### Theme 9: NEGATIVE SYMPTOMS (Medium Priority)

**Concept:** Absence/reduction of normal functions

**Question Types:**
1. **Types:**
   - "What is flat affect?" (Answer: No emotional expression)
   - "What is blunt affect?" (Answer: Reduced emotional expression)
   - "Difference between flat and inappropriate affect?" (Answer: Flat = none; inappropriate = wrong emotion for context)

2. **Positive vs Negative:**
   - "Why are delusions called 'positive' symptoms?" (Answer: Adding something not normally there)
   - "Why is flat affect 'negative'?" (Answer: Removing/reducing normal emotional expression)

3. **Impact:**
   - "How do negative symptoms affect functioning?" (Answer: Impair social interaction, motivation, communication)

**ADHD-Friendly Explanation Style:**
- Simple distinction: "Positive = ADDS abnormal things (hallucinations, delusions); Negative = REMOVES normal things (emotions, motivation)"
- Mechanism: "Brain's emotional processing centers damaged → can't generate/express feelings even if wanted to"

## ADHD-FRIENDLY EXPLANATION REQUIREMENTS

### For EVERY explanation, include:

1. **Concrete Example:** Real scenario or case from PDF
2. **Visual/Spatial Element:** Timeline, comparison chart, or visual metaphor
3. **Mechanism:** WHY it works this way (brain/cognitive process)
4. **Anchor:** Memorable phrase or comparison
5. **Distinction:** What it's NOT (common confusion)

### Example Template:
```
Q: "Patient has delusions for 4 months. Diagnosis?"
A: "Schizophreniform disorder"

Explanation:
DURATION TIMELINE: 1 day → <1 month (brief) → 1-6 months (schizophreniform) → ≥6 months (schizophrenia)

CONCRETE: 4 months falls in the 1-6 month window = schizophreniform.

MECHANISM: The 6-month cutoff marks when acute symptoms transition to chronic brain changes. Before 6 months, there's still possibility of full recovery; after 6 months, brain changes become more persistent.

DISTINCTION: Not schizophrenia yet (needs ≥6 months). Not brief psychotic (that's <1 month).

CLINICAL POINT: If symptoms continue past 6 months, diagnosis CHANGES to schizophrenia.
```
