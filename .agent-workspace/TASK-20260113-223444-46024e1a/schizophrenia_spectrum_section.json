Think of it mathematically: positive = addition. The person gains experiences (voices, beliefs) they didn't have before.

Schizophreniform is essentially a time-limited diagnosis - it captures the same symptom picture as schizophrenia but during the 1-6 month window before we know if symptoms will become chronic.

People with delusional disorder often NEVER get hospitalized because they function normally and may not seek help. Schizophrenia more commonly requires hospitalization due to severe functional impairment and safety concerns.",
          "Schizophrenia patients can work but delusional disorder patients cannot": "This is completely reversed. Delusional disorder patients typically CAN work (examples: accountant, bus driver). Schizophrenia patients often CANNOT maintain employment due to cognitive impairment, negative symptoms, and functional decline.",
          "There is no difference in functioning between these disorders": "Functioning level is one of the MOST important distinctions. Delusional disorder = intact functioning outside delusion. Schizophrenia = significant decline required for diagnosis. This difference has major implications for treatment and prognosis."

      "question": "A 28-year-old presents with a 2-year history of auditory hallucinations, persecutory delusions, recurrent major depressive episodes, AND periods of elevated mood with decreased need for sleep. What is the most likely diagnosis?",

        "Major depressive disorder with psychotic features"
      ],
      "answer": "Schizoaffective disorder",
      "explanation": {
        "correct": "This is schizoaffective disorder. The patient has: (1) Psychotic symptoms - auditory hallucinations and persecutory delusions lasting 2 years, meeting schizophrenia criteria, AND (2) Major mood episodes - both depressive episodes AND elevated mood periods (suggesting manic features). Schizoaffective requires BOTH psychotic symptoms AND major mood episodes. The 2-year duration and presence of both depression and mania alongside continuous psychosis points clearly to schizoaffective.",
        "incorrect": {
          "Schizophrenia": "Schizophrenia does NOT include prominent mood episodes. This patient has recurrent major depressive episodes AND elevated mood periods - these are not minor mood fluctuations but significant mood disturbances. When psychosis + major mood episodes both occur, schizoaffective is the diagnosis.",
          "Bipolar disorder with psychotic features": "In bipolar with psychotic features, psychosis occurs ONLY during mood episodes - when the person is manic or severely depressed. But in schizoaffective, psychotic symptoms persist even BETWEEN mood episodes. This patient has had hallucinations and delusions continuously for 2 years, not just during mood episodes.",
          "Major depressive disorder with psychotic features": "This diagnosis doesn't account for the elevated mood periods (decreased sleep need, presumably increased energy). Also, in MDD with psychotic features, psychosis occurs only during depression. Here, psychosis is continuous over 2 years, spanning multiple mood states."

      "answer": "Somatic delusion",
      "explanation": {
        "correct": "This is a somatic delusion - a fixed false belief about bodily functions or physical abnormalities. Key features: (1) Belief about her body (parasites in intestines), (2) Persists despite objective contradictory evidence (negative tests), (3) Leads to related behavior (researching parasites, seeking treatment). Somatic delusions involve the person's own body, not persecution by others or special significance of events. The maintained work functioning suggests delusional disorder, somatic type.",
        "incorrect": {
          "Persecutory delusion": "Persecutory delusions involve belief that others are harming or targeting you. This patient believes something is wrong with her OWN body, not that external people are hurting her. There's no persecutor in this scenario.",
          "Grandiose delusion": "Grandiose delusions involve believing you have exceptional powers, wealth, or identity. Believing you have a parasitic infection is not grandiose - it's actually a belief about having something WRONG with you, which is somatic.",
          "Delusion of reference": "Delusions of reference involve believing neutral events have special personal meaning (news broadcasts containing messages for you). This patient's belief is specifically about her own body, not about external events carrying hidden messages."

      ],
      "answer": "Flat affect means absence of emotional expression; inappropriate affect means emotions don't match the situation",
      "explanation": {
        "correct": "Flat affect = NO emotional expression at all. The person's face is blank, voice monotone, no visible reaction to anything - sad news, happy news, nothing registers outwardly. Inappropriate affect = emotions are PRESENT but WRONG for the context. The person laughs when hearing about a death, cries when told a joke, shows fear during a happy moment. Both are negative symptoms, but flat is ABSENCE of emotion while inappropriate is MISMATCH between emotion and situation.",
        "incorrect": {
          "Flat affect means exaggerated emotions; inappropriate affect means no emotions": "This is completely reversed. Flat = absence (no emotions showing). Inappropriate = mismatch (emotions showing but wrong ones for the situation).",
          "They are the same thing": "They are distinct phenomena. One involves NO emotional display (flat), the other involves MISMATCHED emotional display (inappropriate). Clinically, they look very different and have different implications.",
          "Flat affect only occurs in depression; inappropriate affect only occurs in schizophrenia": "Both can occur in schizophrenia - they're both classified as negative symptoms. While flat affect can also occur in depression, both types of affect disturbance are seen in schizophrenia spectrum disorders."

      "answer": "Brief psychotic disorder",
      "explanation": {
        "correct": "Brief psychotic disorder has the best prognosis with expectation of FULL recovery. Key features that predict good outcome: (1) Sudden onset (often stress-triggered), (2) Short duration (must be <1 month), (3) Complete return to baseline functioning required for diagnosis, (4) Good insight typically develops afterward. The person recovers fully and often understands in retrospect that the episode was stress-related. This is fundamentally different from schizophrenia's chronic course.",
        "incorrect": {
          "Schizophrenia": "Schizophrenia has the WORST prognosis in the spectrum. It requires ≥6 months of symptoms (chronic), involves significant functional decline, and typically has a long-term, disabling course without treatment. Full recovery is rare.",
          "Schizophreniform disorder": "Schizophreniform has variable prognosis - some patients recover fully, others progress to schizophrenia. It's a 'middle ground' outcome. Not as good as brief psychotic, not as poor as schizophrenia.",
          "Delusional disorder": "Delusional disorder can be chronic (examples in the material lasted 2-3 years) and delusions often persist. While functioning remains intact, the delusion itself may not resolve. Recovery isn't expected the way it is in brief psychotic disorder."

      "explanation": {
        "correct": "Thought broadcasting is the delusion that your private thoughts are being transmitted outward so others can hear, read, or know them. The person believes their mental privacy is violated - their thoughts are 'broadcast' like a radio signal that others receive. This is one of three 'thought delusions': thought insertion (others put thoughts IN), thought withdrawal (others take thoughts OUT), and thought broadcasting (your thoughts go OUT to others).",
        "incorrect": {
          "Believing your thoughts are being removed from your mind by external forces": "This describes thought WITHDRAWAL - the belief that thoughts are being taken OUT of your mind. Broadcasting is the opposite direction - thoughts going FROM your mind TO others.",
          "Believing external thoughts are being inserted into your mind": "This describes thought INSERTION - the belief that thoughts are being put INTO your mind from outside. Broadcasting is your own thoughts going outward, not foreign thoughts coming inward.",
          "Believing you can read other people's thoughts": "This would be telepathy or mind-reading belief. Thought broadcasting specifically means YOUR thoughts are transmitted OUT - others can access YOUR mind, not that you can access theirs."

      "explanation": {
        "correct": "At 3 weeks (21 days), this falls in the brief psychotic disorder range: 1 day to <1 month. Duration determines diagnosis in the spectrum, regardless of how 'severe' or 'schizophrenia-like' symptoms appear. The timeline is strict: <1 month = brief psychotic, 1-6 months = schizophreniform, ≥6 months = schizophrenia. You cannot diagnose schizophreniform until symptoms have lasted at least 1 month, and cannot diagnose schizophrenia until 6 months.",
        "incorrect": {
          "Schizophrenia - symptoms are characteristic": "Duration trumps symptom picture. Even if symptoms look exactly like schizophrenia, you CANNOT diagnose schizophrenia until 6 months have passed. The 6-month requirement is a core criterion.",
          "Schizophreniform disorder - 1-6 month range": "Schizophreniform requires symptoms lasting AT LEAST 1 month. At 3 weeks, we haven't reached the 1-month threshold yet. If symptoms persist past 1 month, THEN the diagnosis would change to schizophreniform.",
          "Delusional disorder - delusions present": "Delusional disorder requires ONLY delusions with no other psychotic symptoms. This patient has symptoms matching full schizophrenia criteria (implying hallucinations, disorganized speech, etc.), ruling out delusional disorder."
