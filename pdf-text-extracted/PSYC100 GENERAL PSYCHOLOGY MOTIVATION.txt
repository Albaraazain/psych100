What is motivation?

◦ Biopsychological approach
◦ Behaviourist approach
◦ Psychodynamic approach
◦ Humanistic approach
◦ Cognitive approach
◦ Evolutionary approach

What is motivation?
◦ Motivation refers, in a general sense, to processes involved in the
initiation, direction, and energization of individual behaviour …(Geen,
1995)
◦ The study of motivation is the study of all those pushes and prods –
biological, social and psychological – that defeat our laziness and move
us, either eagerly or reluctantly, to action (Miller, 1962).
◦ Rubin and McNeil (1983) identify (i) survival or physiological motives, and
(ii) competence or cognitive motives. Social motives represent a third
category.

Drive theory
◦ Based on the concept of our body’s homeostasis.
◦ Homeostasis is the natural tendency to keep the body in a state of equilibrium
(liver, kidneys, brain).
◦ E.g. thirst, hunger

◦ Clark Hull (1943) suggested that physiological disruptions to
homeostasis produce drives (internal tensions that motivate an
organism to engage in behaviour to reduce this tension).

Evaluation
• Drawbacks: dieting, for example, is contrary to the drive to eat. Plus,
people often eat even when they are not really hungry.
● What makes you eat?
● Why do you get hungry?
● How much, if at all, do you consider social factors play a part in your eating
behaviour?

• Reductionist

Instinct theory
◦ Instincts are automatic, involuntary and unlearned patterns of
behaviour triggered by the presence of particular stimuli
◦ E.g. babies are born with a unique ability that allows them to survive: they are
born with the instinct to cry
◦ E.g. coughing, blinking

◦ Buss (1999) suggested that the desire to pass on our genes
may provide the motivational forces for such things as love,
romantic relationships, attraction and marriage.

Evaluation
◦ Ignores learning and environment
◦ It doesn't account for individual differences
◦ Empirical Challenges: Testing instincts is hard because
they're innate, making it difficult to isolate them from learned
responses
◦ Reductionist

Arousal theory
◦ People take certain actions to either decrease or increase levels of
arousal. When arousal levels get too low, for example, a person might
watch an exciting movie or go for a jog. When arousal levels get too
high, a person would probably look for ways to relax such as meditating
or reading a book.
◦ According to this theory, we are motivated to maintain an optimal level
of arousal, although this level can vary based on the individual or the
situation. E.g. parachute jumping
◦ We learn what keeps our own arousal levels at the optimum level.

Evaluation
◦ Neglects Emotional and Social Motivators
◦ Empirical Testing Challenges
◦ Reductionist

WHY ARE PEOPLE MOTIVATED
FOR DIFFERENT REASONS?

Expectancy-value theory
◦ Goal-directed behavior is jointly determined by the strength of the person’s
expectation that particular behaviors will lead to a goal and by the incentive value the
individual places on that goal (Brehm & Self, 1989).
◦ Motivation = expectancy x incentive value.
◦ E.g. A college student preparing for a midterm expects to do well because they’ve
consistently scored high on practice quizzes (high expectancy). They value the exam
because it’s worth 30% of their grade and they aim to get into a post graduate
program(high value). This motivates the student to study hard. Conversely, a student
with low confidence in math (low expectancy) and no interest in the subject (low
value) might skip studying for a calculus test.

Evaluation
◦ Based on subjective experiences (i.e. a student might overestimate
his/her skills).
◦ External influences (i.e. a student might study hard due to financial
constraints).
◦ Overemphasis on rationality (students do not always make calculated
decisions, but emotions, procrastination, or impulsivity often play a
larger role in college settings).
◦ Cultural and social variability

Intrinsic-extrinsic motivation
◦ Cognitive theorists also distinguish between extrinsic motivation,
performing an activity to obtain an external reward or avoid punishment,
and intrinsic motivation, performing an activity for its own sake—
because you find it enjoyable or challenging.
◦ E.g. A student enrolls in a creative writing course because they love
storytelling and find joy in crafting narratives, even if it’s not required for
their major. The process of writing itself is rewarding. INTRINSIC
◦ E.g. A student enrolls in a creative writing course because it’s a very easy
course and he will get a good grade. EXTRINSIC

Evaluation
◦ Over-Simplification of Motivation
◦ Individual Differences: Students vary in how they respond to
intrinsic vs. extrinsic motivators. Personality traits (e.g., high
conscientiousness) or cultural backgrounds (e.g., collectivist
cultures valuing group recognition) influence whether intrinsic or
extrinsic factors are more motivating.
◦ Contextual Factors: External pressures like financial stress can
overshadow both types of motivation. A student might love a
subject (intrinsic) but lack energy to engage due to part-time work
demands.

Achievement motivation
◦ Need for achievement
◦ McClelland and Atkinson proposed that achieve_x0002_ment behavior
can stem from a positively ori_x0002_ented motive for success and a
negatively oriented motivation to avoid failure, more commonly called
fear of failure (1953).
◦ David McClelland and John Atkinson developed methods to measure
achievement motivation primarily through the Thematic Apperception
Test (TAT). The TAT is a projective psychological test where individuals
are shown ambiguous pictures and asked to create stories about them.

Evaluation
◦ The TAT is subjective and relies on trained scorers, which
can introduce variability.
◦ It measures unconscious motives, which may not always
align with explicit behaviors or self-reported goals.
◦ Cultural differences in storytelling styles can affect the
interpretation of results.

Lecture summary
◦ Drive Theory: behavior is motivated by biological needs or drives, such as hunger or thirst, which create
tension that individuals seek to reduce through actions.
◦ Instinct Theory: behaviors are driven by innate, biologically determined instincts that guide actions
without conscious reasoning, such as migration in animals.
◦ Arousal Theory: individuals are motivated to maintain an optimal level of physiological or psychological
arousal, seeking stimulation when under-aroused or calming activities when over-aroused.
◦ Expectancy-Value Theory: motivation depends on the expectation of achieving a goal and the value or
importance placed on that goal.
◦ Intrinsic-Extrinsic Motivation: Intrinsic motivation drives behavior for internal rewards like personal
satisfaction, while extrinsic motivation involves external rewards like money or praise.
◦ Achievement Motivation: an individual’s drive to pursue and attain goals, often measured through
thematic apperception tests for themes of success and effort.
