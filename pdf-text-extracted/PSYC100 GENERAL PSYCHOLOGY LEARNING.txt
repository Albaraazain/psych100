What is learning?
Learning, in the context of psychology, is defined as a relatively
permanent change in behaviour, knowledge, capability, or
attitude that occurs as a result of experience. This process
involves the acquisition, modification, or strengthening of
behaviours (and cognitive structures) through interaction with the
environment, excluding changes due to maturation, fatigue, or
temporary states (Ormrod, 2016).
e.g. maturation (e.g., a child walking due to physical
development), fatigue (e.g., slower reactions when tired), or
temporary states (e.g., altered behavior due to a mood swing

Classical Conditioning- Pavlov
Before conditioning, the taste of food will naturally and automatically
make the dog salivate, but the sound of a bell won’t. So, the food is
referred to as an unconditioned stimulus (UCS), and the salivation is an
unconditioned response (UCR) – an automatic, reflex, biologically builtin response. The dog doesn’t have to learn to salivate in response to
food, because it does so naturally.
During conditioning, the bell is paired with the food. Because the bell
doesn’t naturally produce salivation, it’s called a conditioned stimulus
(CS): it only produces salivation on the condition that it’s paired with the
UCS. It’s also neutral with regard to salivation prior to conditioning.
If the bell and food are paired often enough, the dog starts to salivate as
soon as it hears the bell and before the food is presented. When this
occurs, conditioning has taken place. The salivation is now referred to as
a conditioned response (CR), because it’s produced by a conditioned
stimulus (CS) – the bell.

Classical conditioning

• Generalisation – responding to all similar sounds
• Discrimination – responding only to the conditioned
sound
• Extinction – the response is inhibited if the bell is not
paired with food (not totally eliminated)
• Spontaneous recovery – salivation reappears

Classical conditioning and phobias
• The case of Little Albert (Watson and Rayner, 1920) - conditioning.
• The case of Little Peter (Jones, 194) - unconditioning.
• "Little Albert" experiment (1920), where a baby was conditioned
to fear a white rat through classical conditioning. In contrast, Jones
aimed to uncondition or desensitize a fear response in a young
child, demonstrating that phobias could be reversed through
gradual exposure and positive associations.

Classical conditioning and phobias
"Little Peter" was a healthy, intelligent boy approximately 2 years and 10 months old. Peter
exhibited a strong phobia of furry animals, particularly a white rat, but this fear generalized to
similar stimuli like rabbits, fur coats, feathers, and cotton wool (but not to non-furry objects like
wooden blocks). His reactions included crying, fleeing, and physiological signs of distress (e.g.,
sweating, rapid heartbeat).
Peter was seated at a table with his favorite foods (e.g., candy, crackers, milk) to create a
positive emotional state. The feared stimulus (starting with the rat, then shifting focus to the
rabbit as it elicited stronger fear) was introduced at a safe distance (e.g., across the room).
Over sessions, the distance was gradually reduced while maintaining the pleasant activity,
associating the stimulus with enjoyment rather than fear.
Peter's terror subsided progressively. He stopped crying when the rabbit was nearby, began
tolerating closer proximity, and eventually petted and held the rabbit without distress—
sometimes even enjoying it while eating.

Classical conditioning and phobias

• Think about your phobias
• Is it a learned behaviour?
• How can we treat these phobias?
• Exposure therapy – systematic desensitization

Operant conditioning

• Edward Thorndike’s experiments, particularly his work
with cats in puzzle boxes, were foundational to the
development of operant conditioning, a learning
process later expanded upon by B.F. Skinner.
Thorndike’s research is a cornerstone of operant
conditioning.

Thorndike
• Procedure – re. image
• Observations- Initially, the cat engaged in random
behaviours (e.g., scratching, clawing, or biting the
box) in an attempt to escape, “trial-and-error
learning”; Over time, the cat began to associate the
specific action (e.g., pressing the lever) with the
consequence of escaping and receiving food; With
repeated trials, the time taken to escape decreased
significantly, as the cat learned to perform the
correct action more quickly and efficiently.
• Key Finding: “Law of Effect” behaviours followed by
satisfying consequences were more likely to be
repeated, while behaviours followed by unsatisfying
consequences were less likely to occur again.

Skinner
• Procedure: re image
• Observations: Initially, the rat would explore the box and
accidentally press the lever, receiving a food pellet. Over time,
the rat learned to associate lever-pressing with the reward,
increasing the frequency of this behaviour; Skinner noted that
the rate and pattern of lever-pressing depended on the type
and timing of the consequences. For instance: Continuous
reinforcement (reward every time the lever was pressed) led
to rapid learning. Intermittent reinforcement (reward
delivered only occasionally, e.g., every third press or at
random intervals) made the behaviour more resistant to
extinction (stopping when rewards ceased); If a punishment
(e.g., a mild shock) was delivered after lever-pressing, the
behaviour decreased.
• Key Finding: Skinner’s experiments demonstrated that
behaviour is shaped by reinforcement (consequences that
increase behaviour) and punishment (consequences that
decrease behaviour).

Some examples

• Positive reinforcement
- An employee meets a
sales target and
receives a bonus. This
motivates them to
continue working hard
to achieve future
bonuses.
• Negative reinforcement
- A driver buckles their
seatbelt to stop the
car's annoying warning
beep. The removal of
the beep encourages
consistent seatbelt use.

• Positive punishment - A
teenager breaks curfew
and is assigned extra
chores by their parents.
The added chores
discourage future
curfew violations.
• Negative punishment A driver receives a
speeding ticket,
resulting in the loss of
money (fine). This
financial penalty
discourages speeding in
the future.

reinforcement

Comparison of CC and OC
• They’re both types of associative learning.
• In CC, learning happens involuntarily, in OC learning is voluntary.
• In CC, the stimulus is guaranteed to produce the response, while the
likelihood of a particular operant response being emitted is a function of
the past consequences of such behaviour.
• In CC, the UCS works in basically the same way regardless of whether it’s
pleasurable or aversive; in OC, responses that result in pleasurable
outcomes are likely to be repeated, while those that result in aversive
outcomes aren’t.
• In CC, the reinforcer is presented regardless of what the animal does and is
presented before the response. In OC, the reinforcer is only presented if
the animal emits some specified, pre-selected behaviour, and is presented
after the behaviour.

Do principles of learning apply to all species?
• According to the concept of preparedness (Seligman, 1970), animals are
biologically prepared to learn actions that are closely related to the
survival of their species (such as learned water or food aversions), and
these prepared behaviours are learned with very little training. However,
contraprepared behaviours are contrary to an animal’s natural tendencies,
and so are learned with great difficulty, if at all.
• E.g. E.g. Susan Mineka (1980s) on rhesus monkeys showed they quickly learned to
fear snakes after observing other monkeys react fearfully to them, even through
video. This fear was acquired after just one or two exposures and persisted longer
than fears conditioned to neutral stimuli like flowers.

• Same for humans.
• E.g. Ohman et al. (1975) – humans can easily be conditioned to fear spiders and
snakes, but not to flowers, houses or berries.

Do principles of learning apply to all species?
•Fear of heights: conditioning studies where fear of heights is easily
strengthened (Gibson & Walk, 1960)
•Fear of the dark: Studies (e.g., Grillon et al., 1997) show that fear
responses to dark environments paired with aversive stimuli (e.g., loud
noises) are stronger and more resistant to extinction than fears of bright,
open spaces.
•Öhman and Mineka’s work contrasted fear conditioning to evolutionarily
relevant stimuli (snakes) with modern ones (electrical outlets). While shocks
paired with outlets can induce fear, it requires more trials, is weaker, and
extinguishes faster compared to snake-related fears.

Cognitive approaches
• Social Learning Theory (Bandura, 1977): While not
denying the role of both classical and operant
conditioning, SLT focuses on observational learning
(or modelling), in which cognitive factors are
crucial.
• e.g. Bobo doll experiment

• Tolman’s Cognitive Behaviourism – his maze
experiments, particularly his work with rats in the
1930s, were pivotal in challenging the strict
behaviourist views of learning and introducing the
concept of cognitive learning.
• Kohler’s experiment with chimps.

Tolman concluded that Group
3 had been learning the
maze’s layout during the nonrewarded trials, even though
they didn’t demonstrate this
learning until a reward was
introduced. This phenomenon
was termed latent learning
(“cognitive maps”)

Comparison of operant conditioning and latent
learning

• Operant conditioning, as developed by Skinner,
emphasizes that behaviours are shaped by immediate
consequences (reinforcement or punishment). Tolman’s
findings showed that learning can occur without
immediate reinforcement and be expressed later when
a reinforcer is introduced.

Tolman concluded that Group 3 had been learning the maze’s layout during the non-rewarded tria

Kohler (1925) has demonstated that chimps learn by INSIGHT (the sudden
perception of a useful relationship that helps to solve a problem).

What about learned helplessness?
• A condition where an individual/animal, after repeated exposure to uncontrollable
negative events, develops a belief that they cannot influence outcomes, leading to
passivity and reduced motivation to act, even when control is possible (Seligman, 1960s).
• Classical Conditioning: Learned helplessness involves associating an aversive stimulus
with a lack of control, leading to a conditioned response of helplessness or resignation.
• Operant Conditioning: When actions (e.g., attempts to escape or solve a problem)
consistently fail to produce desired outcomes, the individual learns that their behavior
has no effect, reducing future attempts (negative reinforcement of passivity).
• Cognitive Learning: The cognitive aspect of learned helplessness emphasizes the role of
perception and belief. Individuals internalize the idea that they are powerless, which
shapes their expectations and behavior in new situations.
