What is perception?
• Perception is the organisation and interpretation of incoming sensory
information to form inner representations of the external world.
• We don’t perceive ‘reality’ at all but only how our brain interprets it
(Macknik & Martinez-Conde, 2014).
• Ehrenfels (1890) claimed that many groups of stimuli acquire a
pattern quality that is greater than the sum of their parts.
• E.g. Melody. If you hear the notes of a song played individually, they’re just
separate sounds. But when played together in sequence, they form a
recognizable melody with a unique quality

• Gestalt Psychology argues that our brain organizes sensory
information—like shapes, sounds, or images—into meaningful
wholes.
• E.g. face

What is perception?
• Distal stimulus – the object you are looking at
• Proximal stimulus – the pattern of stimulation that hits
the retina
• While the distal stimulus is constant, the proximal stimulus
varies.
• A major issue for perception is how your perception
remains constant when the proximal stimulation is so
variable.

Gestalt principles of perceptual
organization
1. Figure-ground separation
2. Proximity
3. Closure
4. Similarity
5. Continuity
6. Symmetry

* 2-6 are called Laws of perception

Figure-ground separation
The first perceptual task when
confronted with an object (or figure)
is to recognise it. To do this, we must
perceive the figure as being distinct
from its surroundings (or ground).

Proximity
Occurs when elements are placed close together. They tend
to be perceived as a group.
The Gestalt principle of
proximity suggests that you
see (a) one block of dots on
the left side and (b) three
columns on the right side.

Closure
We tend to complete incomplete forms and generally fill in
the gaps
Closure suggests that
we will perceive a
complete circle and
rectangle rather than a
series of segments.

Similarity
Similar parts of a form are more likely to be perceived as
belonging together than parts that are dissimilar.
When looking at this array of
dots, we likely perceive
alternating rows of colours. We
are grouping these dots
according to the principle of
similarity.

Continuity
We group stimuli into forms that follow continuous lines or
patterns.
Good continuation would
suggest that we are more
likely to perceive this as two
overlapping lines, rather
than four lines meeting in
the center.

Symmetry
• Elements that are symmetrical to each other tend to be
perceived as a unified group.
• Similar to the law of similarity, this rule suggests that
objects that are symmetrical with each other will be more
likely to be grouped together than objects not symmetrical
with each other.

We see these shapes as two overlapping diamonds instead of as two touching
corner bricks or an octahedron with a square in the middle.

Depth perception
• Depth perception is the ability to see things in a 3dimensional way and to judge distance.
• We use depth cues to gather information on the images we
see. These cues are monocular and binocular cues.
• Binocular cues involve both eyes and rely on their working
together, while monocular cues are available to each eye
separately.

Non-pictorial cues
Nonpictorial cues involve the physical functioning of the eyes and brain
rather than interpreting visual patterns in a scene. They include:
Retinal Disparity (Binocular Cue): The slight difference in the images
projected on each retina due to the eyes' horizontal separation. The brain
uses this disparity to estimate depth, especially for objects within a few
meters.
Convergence (Binocular Cue): The inward rotation of the eyes to
focus on a nearby object. The degree of convergence (angle of eye
movement) provides the brain with information about an object’s distance.

23

Pictorial cues
• These refer to features of the
visual field itself (rather than to
the eyes), and are all also
monocular.
1. Relative Size: Objects that
are farther away appear smaller
than similar objects that are
closer.

24

Pictorial cues
2. Interposition
(Occlusion): When one
object partially blocks another,
the blocked object is perceived
as farther away.

25

Pictorial cues
3. Linear Perspective:
Parallel lines (e.g., railroad
tracks) appear to converge as
they recede into the distance,
signaling depth.

26

Pictorial cues
4. Texture Gradient:
Textures appear denser and
less detailed as they get farther
away.

27

Pictorial cues
5. Light and Shadow: The
way light falls on objects
creates shadows that indicate
their shape and position in 3D
space.

28

Pictorial cues
6. Aerial Perspective:
Distant objects appear hazier
or less vivid due to atmospheric
scattering of light, suggesting
greater distance.

29

Pictorial cues
7. Relative Height: Objects
higher in the visual field (closer
to the horizon) are perceived as
farther away, especially in
landscapes.

30

Perceptual consistency
• The ability to perceive an object as unchanging, despite
changes in the sensory information that reaches our eyes,
is called perceptual constancy.
• Size constancy
• Shape constancy
• Brightness constancy
• Colour constancy
• Location constancy

31

Size constancy
The brain perceives an object’s
size as constant, even though
its retinal image changes with
distance. For example, a
person appears the same size
whether they are 5 or 50 feet
away, despite the retinal image
being smaller at a distance
(Ramachandran and RogersRamachandran, 2004).
32

Ames Room (Ames, 1946)
In the Ames room, the
walls, floor, and ceiling are
trapezoidal, not
rectangular. Your brain
interprets both corners as
being at the same
distance, even though one
is farther away.

33

Shape constancy
An object’s shape is perceived
as consistent, even when
viewed from different angles,
which alters its retinal
projection. For example, a door
appears rectangular whether
viewed head-on or at an angle,
where it projects a trapezoid on
the retina.

34

Brightness constancy
Objects are perceived as
having consistent brightness,
even when illumination
changes. For example, a white
shirt appears equally white in
bright sunlight or dim shade,
despite differences in light
intensity reaching the retina.

35

Colour constancy
The brain perceives an
object’s colour as stable
under different lighting
conditions. For example, a
red apple looks red in
sunlight or under fluorescent
light, even though the
wavelengths reflected
change.

36

Location constancy
• Moving our heads around produces a constantly changing
pattern of retinal images, yet we don’t perceive the world as
spinning around. This is because kinaesthetic

37

Illusions
• These offer examples of how perception can be wrong and how what we
see is not the truthful reflection of what's out there
• Perception is based not only on the stimulus but also knowledge and
experience
• The Ponzo illusion
• The Horizontal-Vertical illusion
• The Muller-Lyer illusion
• The Poggendorf illusion
• Titchener’s circles

38

The Ponzo Illusion
The horizontal bar at the top is
seen as being longer than the
horizontal line at the bottom,
even though they’re both the
same length.

39

The Horizontal-Vertical Illusion
The vertical line appears longer
than the horizontal line – even
though they’re of equal length.

40

The Muller-Lyer Illusion
The line with the outgoing fins
appears to be longer than the
line with the ingoing fins, but in
fact they’re the same length.

41

The Poggendorf Illusion
Seems like the segments of the
diagonal line are offset, even
though they’re not.

42

Titchener’s circles
The central circle in the lefthand group is seen as being
larger than the central circle of
the right-hand group, but
they’re both the same size.

43

Theories of Visual Perception
1. Gestalt Theory (as discussed - "the whole is greater than the
sum of its parts.“

2. Constructivist Theory (Gregory, 1966) - perception is an
active, constructive process. The brain uses sensory input, prior
knowledge, and expectations to build an interpretation of the visual
world. Perception is driven by higher-level cognitive processes, such as
memory, experience, and context. For instance, we recognize a blurry
image as a face because we’ve seen faces before.
e.g. When reading messy handwriting, your brain uses context and
prior knowledge of words to decipher the text, even if some letters are
unclear.

44

Theories of Visual Perception
3. Ecological Theory (Gibson, 1966) - perception is direct and
does not require complex cognitive processing. The environment
provides all the information needed for perception through
"affordances" (cues about how objects can be used). Gibson’s theory
emphasizes the interaction between organisms and their environment,
focusing on real-world, ecological contexts rather than lab-based
stimuli.
e.g. When walking through a forest, you perceive the ground’s texture
and slopes directly, allowing you to navigate without consciously
analyzing every step.

Theory

Key
assumptions

Perception is direct and bottom-up;
we "pick up" invariant information
from the environment without
needing inferences.

Perception is indirect and top-down; the
brain constructs perceptions by testing
hypothesis based on sensory data and prior
knowledge.

Role of
environment

Central; the optic array provides rich, Provides incomplete or ambiguous sensory
unambiguous information (e.g.,
input, which must be supplemented by
affordances) that specifies what

actions are possible.

Role of
cognition

Minimal; perception happens as a
result of direct resonance with the
environment.

Essential; involves active interpretation
using past experiences, expectations, and
inferences.

Explanation
of illusions

Occur due to insufficient or artificial
environmental information (e.g., in
lab settings), not cognitive errors.

Result from misapplied hypotheses or
perceptual errors based on prior knowledge
(e.g., size illusions from depth cues).

46

Theories of Visual Perception
While Gregory’s constructivist (‘top-down’) and Gibson’s
direct (‘bottom-up’) approaches may appear to contradict
each other, it’s possible to see them as complementary.
According to Harris (1998): “Perception is not just a single
task but …contributes in many different ways to everyday life
… Some of these … are obviously more difficult than others
and it seems likely that some can be accomplished directly,
as Gibson maintained, whilst others may require
sophisticated internal knowledge and are thus better
described by the indirect approach.”
