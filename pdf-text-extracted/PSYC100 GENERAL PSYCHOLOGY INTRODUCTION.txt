What is psychology?
A brief history
The relationship between psychology and other disciplines
Main areas of psychology
The scientific study of human behaviour

What is psychology?
The word ‘psychology’ is derived from the Greek psyche (mind, soul or spirit)
and logos (knowledge, discourse or study). Literally, then, Psychology is the
‘study of the mind’.
Psychology is the scientific study of the mind, brain, and behaviour, exploring
thoughts, emotions, and actions to understand individuals and groups. It's a
diverse, interdisciplinary field that uses research and experimentation to gain
insights into human development, mental processes, and the factors—
biological, social, and environmental—that influence how we think, feel, and
behave.

A brief history
1879 Wilhelm Wundt opens first experimental psychology lab in Leipzig - Psychology separates from
philosophy, becoming an independent science focused on introspection and experimentation.
1883 Stanley Hall opens first U.S. psychology lab at Johns Hopkins - Expanded scientific
psychology globally, emphasizing research.
1885 Hermann Ebbinghaus publishes on memory experiments - Demonstrated systematic selfexperimentation, solidifying cognitive psychology's scientific basis.
1886 Sigmund Freud begins psychoanalysis - Introduced talk therapy and unconscious mind
theories, adding depth to scientific inquiry into mental processes.
1888 Cattell publishes on mental tests - Advanced psychological assessment with standardized
measurements, enhancing scientific rigor.

A brief history
1892 formation of American Psychological Association - Professionalized the field, fostering
scientific collaboration and standards.
1904 Ivan Pavlov’s work on classical conditioning - Introduced behavioral experiments,
shifting focus to observable responses and scientific objectivity.
1905 Binet first IQ test - Developed empirical tools for measuring cognition, advancing
psychometrics as a science.
1912 Gestalt Psychology - studies of perception, enriching scientific approaches.
1913 - 1920 Watson’s Behaviourism and Little Albert Experiment - emphasized
experimentation over introspection
1932 Jean Piaget - Used empirical observation to map child cognition, establishing
developmental psychology as a science.

A brief history
1935

1960s–1970s

Skinner’s Operant Conditioning experiments Built on behaviorism with rigorous experiments on
reinforcement, solidifying scientific behavior
analysis.

Rise of neuroscience and psychopharmacology Linked psychology to brain science via tools like
EEG and MRI, enhancing biological validity.

1960s Cognitive revolution (e.g., Noam Chomsky,
George Miller) - Shifted to scientific study of mental
processes using computer models, integrating with
information science

1950s

A brief history
1980s–1990s Positive psychology emerges (Martin Seligman) - Focused on empirical study of well-being and
strengths, expanding beyond pathology
2000s Integration of genetics and psychology (e.g., behavioral genetics) - Used scientific methods like twin studies
to explore heritability of traits.
2010s Digital psychology and big data - Leveraged technology for large-scale behavioral analysis, making
psychology more data-driven.
2021–2023 Studies on social media, loneliness, and AI-inspired models - Empirical research on modern issues like
TikTok's impact on adolescents and machine learning in cognitive modeling.
2024–2025 Advancements in AI therapy, telehealth, digital therapeutics etc. - Psychology integrates with tech
(e.g., AI chatbots for mental health, brain-computer interfaces) and neuroscience (e.g., immune system's role in
anxiety), expanding access and precision in evidence-based interventions.

Main areas of psychology

The relationship between psychology and
other disciplines

Does psychology have deep connections
with other fields?
Computer engineering
Software engineering
Industrial engineering
Mechanical engineering
Civil engineering
Electrical & Electronic engineering
Chemical engineering
Aerospace engineering
Also Business Administration, Economics, Political Science, EFL

Some examples
Mechanical engineering: understanding human error and stress when designing systems.
Civil engineering: how buildings, cities affect mental health and behaviour.
Electrical & Electronic engineering: designing devices that monitor stress, mood or
cognitive performance.
Chemical engineering: working with neuropsychologists to develop drugs that affect the
brain.
Aerospace engineering: aviation psychology, studying pilot cognition, fatigue and decisionmaking.
Computer engineering: HCI, user experience, cybersecurity, AI.
EFL: effective language teaching and learning involve understanding cognitive, emotional,
social, and motivational processes.
PSIR: human behavior, cognition, and emotions underpin political and international
dynamics

The scientific study of human behaviour
Wilhelm Wundt - the founder of the new science of Experimental Psychology; used

introspection ( looking inside); structuralism (structure of the mind)
William James – functionalism (function of the mind); individual differences
John Watson – critical of introspection; behaviourism, influenced by Pavlov; Little
Albert experiment
McCarthy, Chompsky and Miller – cognitive revolution; various academics met to
discuss the possibility of producing computer programs that could ‘behave’ or ‘think’
intelligently. These academics included McCarthy (generally attributed with having
coined the term ‘artificial intelligence’), Chomsky and Miller.

Major features of a science

What makes psychology a science?
1. Empirical evidence (observable, measurable data collection).
2. Scientific method (hypothesis testing, analysing results, drawing
conclusions).
3. Theories and models (psychology develops testable theories i.e.
cognitive dissonance, attachment theory).
4. Experimentation (studies cause-effect relationships).
5. Quantitative and qualitative methods
6. Falsifiability (theories can be tested and disproven)

The scientific study of human behaviour
•

The social nature of science: the problem of objectivity - Psychologists are part of their own

•

The Psychology experiment as a social situation

•

The problem of representativeness

•

The problem of artificiality

•

The problem of internal vs external validity

subject matter, which makes it even more difficult for them to be objective than other scientists.
•
•

Experimenter bias - expectations
Demand characteristics – interpretation of experiment’s purpose

•

Culture?

•

Generalizability?

•
•

High internal validity means that the observed effects are due to the manipulation of the IV.
High external validity means results can be generalised to other settings, populations, or times.

“

Psychology, as a science, seeks to
explain the complexities of the human
mind through rigorous observation and
experimentation.
Carl Gustav Jung

Summary
• While Psychology sometimes faces challenges, like the
complexity of human behaviour or ethical limits on
experimentation, its commitment to evidence-based methods
aligns it with other sciences like biology or physics.
• Recognizing and actively addressing the limitations are crucial
for maintaining the scientific rigor and validity of psychological
