I - The Biopsychological
Approach
How much of our behaviour do you believe to be
determined by nature (genetics) or nurture
(environment, upbringing, culture, friends etc.)

The Biopsychological Approach
The biopsychological approach emphasizes that psychological phenomena are rooted in biological
processes. In other words, to understand why we feel anxious, learn a new skill, or even fall in
love, we must look at the brain, nervous system, genetics, and endocrine system.
For example:
Schizophrenia – excess dopamine
Depression – low serotonin
Addiction – dopamine reward pathways
Extroversion – low arousal levels
Aggression – testosterone levels

The Biopsychological Approach
The impact of biology on our behaviour; how the brain, the nervous system, the hormones
and genetics influence our behaviour.
Behaviour genetics:
1. genetic differences
2. shared environments
3. non-shared environments
Examples: intelligence, personality, addiction
Two major methods: twin studies and adoption studies

Twin studies
Twin studies compare identical (monozygotic, MZ) twins, who share nearly 100% of their
DNA, with fraternal (dizygotic, DZ) twins, who share about 50% of their DNA (like typical
siblings). By examining similarities and differences in traits between these groups,
researchers can estimate the heritability of a trait (CONCORDANCE RATE)—how much of
the variation is due to genetics versus environment.
If MZ twins are more similar for a trait (e.g., intelligence, depression) than DZ twins, genetics
likely plays a stronger role, since both twin types are typically raised in similar environments.
If both MZ and DZ twins show similar levels of similarity, the environment is likely the
dominant factor.

Twin studies
The equal environments assumption posits that MZ and DZ twins experience similar
environmental influences (e.g., parenting, socioeconomic status). This allows differences in
trait similarity to be attributed to genetics.

1. Classical Twin Design: Compares MZ and DZ twins raised together.
2. Twins Reared Apart: Studies MZ twins separated at birth and raised in different
environments. This isolates genetic effects by minimizing shared environmental influences.
CAUTION HERE!!!

Adoption studies
Adoption studies examine individuals raised by non-biological (adoptive) parents to separate
genetic influences from environmental ones. By comparing adopted children to their
biological parents (genetic influence) and adoptive parents (environmental influence),
researchers can isolate these factors.

If adopted children resemble their biological parents more than their adoptive parents for a
trait, genetics likely plays a stronger role. If they resemble their adoptive parents, the
environment is key.

Criticisms
Reductionism: It oversimplifies complex behaviours to biology, ignoring culture or
environment (nature vs. nurture debate).
Ethical Concerns: Animal testing and genetic editing raise issues.
Determinism: Suggests biology determines everything, though neuroplasticity shows
change is possible.

II - The Behaviourist Approach
Classical conditioning - Classical
conditioning is a learning process where a
neutral stimulus becomes associated with an
unconditioned stimulus to elicit a conditioned
response.
UCS (Unconditioned Stimulus), CS
(Conditioned Stimulus), UCR (Unconditioned
Response), and CR (Conditioned Response)

The Behaviourist Approach
Operant conditioning -Unlike classical
conditioning, which involves automatic
responses to stimuli, operant conditioning
focuses on voluntary behaviours and how
their outcomes influence whether they’re
repeated
Positive Reinforcement, Negative
Reinforcement, Positive Punishment,
Negative Punishment

7 key assumptions
1. Behavior is Learned: All behaviors are acquired through interactions with the environment via conditioning
(classical or operant). Innate or inherited factors are minimized.
2. Observable Behavior is the Focus: Only measurable, observable behaviors are studied. Internal mental states
(thoughts, emotions) are considered irrelevant or inaccessible for scientific study.
3. Environmental Determinism: Behavior is primarily determined by external stimuli and reinforcements, not free
will or internal processes.
4. Conditioning Drives Learning: Either Classical Conditioning (Pavlov): Behaviors are learned through
associations between stimuli (e.g., a bell triggering salivation in dogs), or Operant Conditioning (Skinner):
Behaviors are shaped by consequences (rewards or punishments).
5. Tabula Rasa (Blank Slate): Humans and animals start as blank slates, and behavior is shaped entirely by
experience and learning.
6. Generalization Across Species: Principles of behavior (e.g., conditioning) apply universally to humans and
animals, allowing animal studies to inform human behavior.
7. Predictability and Control: Behavior can be predicted and controlled by manipulating environmental stimuli and
reinforcements.

Criticisms
Overemphasis on Observable Behaviour
Neglect of Innate Factors
Overreliance on Animal Studies
Deterministic View
Ethical Concerns
Failure to Address Individual Differences

III – The Psychodynamic
Approach
While Freud’s psychoanalytic theory was the original
Psychodynamic theory, the Psychodynamic theories of
Jung (1964), Adler (1927) and Erikson (1950) aren’t
psychoanalytic. Because of his enormous influence,
Freud will be our focus.

Sigmund Freud
Levels of the mind: Pre-conscious, Conscious, Unconscious
Personality: Id, Ego, Superego
Psychosexual Stages of Development
Defence mechanisms

Id – pleasure principle
Ego – reality principle
Superego – morality principle

Criticisms
Lack of empirical evidence/ Unfalsifiable concepts
Overemphasis on sexuality
Gender bias
Neglect of social and cultural influences

IV – The Humanistic Perspective
Both the Psychoanalytic and Behaviourist approaches are deterministic: people are driven by
forces beyond their control, either unconscious forces from within (Freud) or reinforcements
from outside (Skinner). Humanistic Psychologists believe in people’s ability to choose how
they act. It emphasizes individual potential, personal growth, self-actualization, and subjective
experience

Abraham Maslow – needs hierarchy, self-actualization, positive growth
Carl Rogers – self concept, unconditional positive regard, conditions of worth, fully
functioning person

Comparison of Maslow and Rogers
Similarities:
Focus on Self-Actualization: Both Maslow and Rogers saw self-actualization as a central human drive,
emphasizing personal growth and fulfillment.
Positive View of Humanity: They rejected deterministic or pathology-focused views (e.g., Freud’s
psychoanalysis) and instead highlighted human potential, creativity, and autonomy.
Holistic Approach: Both viewed individuals as whole beings, not just products of biology or environment,
and emphasized subjective experience.
Difference:
Structure of Motivation: Maslow proposed a structured hierarchy of needs, with clear stages; Rogers
focused on a more fluid actualizing tendency, without a rigid sequence.

Rogers
Perceived self = Actual self

Criticisms
Concepts are difficult to test empirically.
Overly optimistic view of human nature.
Overemphasis on subjective experiences.

V – The Cognitive Approach
Cognitive Psychology doesn’t have a unifying theory and, unlike other ‘brands’ of
Psychology, it lacks an acknowledged figure: such as Watson, Freud and
Rogers and their respective approaches (Wade and Tavris, 1990).
It focuses on mental processes such as perception, memory, thinking, problemsolving, and decision-making. It views the mind as an information-processing
system, akin to a computer, and emphasizes how people actively interpret and
make sense of their experiences.
E.g. Tolman and his cognitive maps

Key theories, models and real
life applications
Memory Models: Atkinson and Shiffrin, and Baddeley (TBD later on)
Cognitive Development: Piaget (TBD later on)
Cognitive Behavioural Therapy: Beck (TBD later on)
Rational Emotive Behaviour Therapy: Ellis (TBD later on)
Artificial Intelligence

Criticisms
Overemphasis on Mental Processes
The mind-as-computer metaphor oversimplifies human cognition, ignoring
creativity, intuition, or subjective experiences that humanism prioritizes.
Reductionist

VI – The Evolutionary Approach
Evolutionary psychology is a theoretical approach to psychology that explains human mental
and behavioural traits as adaptations shaped by natural selection to address survival and
reproductive challenges in ancestral environments. It integrates principles from evolutionary
biology, cognitive psychology, and anthropology, positing that the human mind consists of
specialized cognitive mechanisms, or "modules," designed to solve specific adaptive
problems like finding food or selecting mates.
EP is, in general, about universal features of the mind. In so far as individual differences
exist, the default assumption is that they’re expressions of the same universal human nature
as it encounters different environments. Gender is the crucial exception to this rule. Natural
selection has constructed the mental modules of men and women in very different ways as a
result of their divergent reproductive roles .

Evolutionary psychology principles applied
to human behaviour
1. Mate Preferences and Sexual Selection - Evolutionary psychology suggests that
mate preferences evolved to maximize reproductive success. Men and women developed
distinct preferences.
Men’s Preference for Physical Attractiveness & Women’s Preference for Resources (Buss,
1989).
2. Fear of Snakes and Spiders - Innate fears of certain animals may have evolved to
protect humans from dangerous threats in the environment of evolutionary adaptedness
(Öhman & Mineka, 2001).

Evolutionary psychology principles applied
to human behaviour
3. Parental Investment and Attachment - Parents invest heavily in offspring to ensure their
survival, but strategies differ due to biological costs. Mothers, with higher reproductive costs
(pregnancy, nursing), tend to be more nurturing, while fathers may focus on resource provision.
Mother-infant bonding is rapid and intense, driven by oxytocin release during childbirth and
breastfeeding, fostering attachment to ensure infant survival. Fathers may show conditional
investment based on paternity certainty (Bowlby, 1969). Mommy’s baby, daddy’s may be!
4. Jealousy as a Mate-Retention Strategy - Jealousy evolved to protect relationships from
threats, ensuring reproductive success by preventing partner loss. Men are more distressed by sexual
infidelity, while women are more concerned about emotional infidelity (Buss et al, 1992).

Criticisms
Falsifiability
Reductionism
Misinterpretation (may be misused to justify social inequalities)

• Different theoretical approaches are based on different models of the
nature of human beings.
• Biopsychological approach attempt to quantify how much of the
variability of any given trait can be attributed to heritability, shared
environments or non-shared environments.

Summary

• The Behaviourist approach stresses the role of environmental influences
(learning), especially classical and operant conditioning. Psychology’s
aim is to predict and control behaviour.
• The Psychodynamic approach is based on Freud’s psychoanalytic
theory, which stresses the unconscious (especially repression), infantile
sexuality and the impact of early experience.
• Humanistic approach believes in free will and stresses the importance of
positive aspects of human development.
• The Cognitive approach analogies and metaphors when trying to
describe what’s going on inside the brain, in particular the computer
analogy and the view of people as information processors.
• Evolutionary approach mentions mechanism or modules which are
believed to be fixed and universal.
