◦ Early experiences and attachment
◦ Development of self concept
◦ Cognitive development and Piaget’s Theory
◦ Zone of Proximal Development - Vygotsky

I - What is attachment?
◦ According to Kagan et al. (1978), an attachment is: ... an intense emotional
relationship that is specific to two people, that endures over time, and in which
prolonged separation from the partner is accompanied by stress and sorrow.
◦ Our first attachment acts as a prototype (or model) for all later relationships.
◦ Harlow’s experiments with monkeys
◦ John Bowlby
◦ Mary Ainsworth

Harlow’s monkey experiments
◦ To study whether attachment in infants is based on biological needs (feeding) or emotional comfort (contact
and security).

◦ Monkeys overwhelmingly preferred the cloth mother, even though she provided no food.
◦ They only went to the wire mother briefly to feed, then immediately returned to the cloth mother.

Harlow’s follow-up studies
1. Isolation studies: Monkeys raised in total isolation (no mother, no peers) became emotionally disturbed,
socially withdrawn, and often self-harming; When reintroduced to others, they were fearful or aggressive and
struggled to mate or care for offspring.
2. Partial isolation studies: Monkeys could see and hear others but not touch them; Still developed abnormal
behaviors, showing that physical affection and social contact are crucial.

CONCLUSIONS:
- Attachment is not just about feeding — it’s about security, comfort, and love.
- Touch and emotional warmth are essential for healthy psychological development.
- Lack of attachment can lead to severe long-term emotional damage.

John Bowlby (1950s-60s)
•Bowlby, a British psychologist, was the first to propose that
attachment is an innate biological system that evolved to ensure
survival (evolutionary).
•He argued that children are born with an instinct to seek closeness
to a caregiver when they feel threatened, frightened, or ill.
•The caregiver provides a secure base from which the child can
explore the world and a safe haven for comfort.
•The critical period for forming primary attachment according to
Bowlby is roughly from birth to about 3 years of age

John Bowlby (1950s-60s)
◦ Bowlby believed that infants display a strong innate tendency to become attached to
one particular adult female (not necessarily the natural mother).
◦ For Bowlby (1951): Mother love in infancy is as important for mental health as are
vitamins and proteins for physical health.
◦ Although Bowlby didn’t deny that children form multiple attachments, he saw
attachment to the mother as being unique: it’s the first to develop and is the strongest
of all.
◦ However, Schaffer and Emerson showed that multiple attachments seem to be the
rule rather than the exception. FATHERS!

Mary Ainsworth (1970s)
◦ Ainsworth expanded Bowlby’s theory with her “Strange Situation”
experiment (1970s), which observed how infants reacted to separations
and reunions with their mothers.
◦ Studied how infants (12-18 months old) form attachments and react to
separation and reunion with their caregiver.
◦ Identified 4 main attachment styles.

Deprivation and Privation

Are the effects of privation reversible?
◦ Yes!
1. Case studies of children who’ve endured extreme early privation, often in near
complete isolation.
e.g. Czech twins
2. Studies of late adoption
e.g. Romanian orphanages

Czech Twins (Andreas and Petr, discovered 1972,
age ~7)
After their mother died, their stepmother locked them
in a cellar or unheated room with almost no human
contact, light, or stimulation until age 7 (along with an
older brother who was less affected).
At discovery: almost no speech, severe intellectual
disability (IQ ~40), autistic-like behaviors, no social
attachment.
Outcome after intensive rehabilitation: dramatic
recovery. By adolescence their IQs rose to lownormal range (~90–100), they developed normal
language and social relationships, finished school,
and lived relatively normal adult lives.

Romanian Orphanages
Led by Michael Rutter, Jana Kreppner, and others
since the early 1990s.
Background: After the 1989 fall of Ceaușescu in
Romania, the world discovered thousands of children
in state orphanages with extreme deprivation:
Almost no caregiver interaction (ratios sometimes
1:30–1:60 for infants); Minimal language exposure,
little play, severe malnutrition in early years; Many
children spent months/years lying in cots with almost
no stimulation.
There is a clear sensitive period: deprivation lasting
beyond roughly 6 months markedly increases risk;
beyond 24 months the risk is very high.

ACE and attachment
Attachment theory and
Adverse Childhood
Experiences (ACEs) are two
deeply interconnected
concepts in psychology and
health research, both
highlighting the profound,
long-term impact of early life
experiences on an individual's
physical and mental wellbeing, as well as their
relationships throughout life.

II – The Self Concept
◦ ‘Self ’ and ‘self-concept’ are used interchangeably to refer to an
individual’s overall self-awareness.
◦ According to Murphy (1947), ‘the self is the individual as known to the
individual’.
◦ Components of the self-concept are self-image (WHO AM I?), selfesteem (HOW I FEEL ABOUT MYSELF?), ideal-self (WHO I WANT TO
BE?).

Developmental changes in the selfconcept
◦ During the first few months, the baby gradually distinguishes itself from its
environment and from other people.
◦ According to Maccoby (1980), babies are able to distinguish between themselves and
others on two counts:
1. their own fingers hurt when bitten (but they don’t have any such sensations when
they’re biting their rattle or their mother’s fingers)
2. probably quite early in life, they begin to associate feelings from their own body
movements with the sight of their own limbs and the sounds of their own cries.
• Gallup (1977) studies on chimps

◦ Lewis and Brooks-Gunn (979) have used
modified forms of Gallup’s technique with 6to 24-month-old children. The mother
applies a dot of rouge to the child’s nose
(while pretending to wipe its face), and the
child is observed to see how often it touches
its nose. It is then placed in front of a mirror,
and again the number of times it touches its
nose is recorded. While touching the dot
was never seen before 15 months, between
15 and 18 months, 5–25 per cent of infants
touched it, and 75 per cent of the 18- to 24month-old infants did.

III – Cognitive development
◦ According to Piaget, cognitive development occurs through the interaction of innate capacities with environmental
events, and progresses through a series of hierarchical, qualitatively different, stages.
1) All children pass through the stages in the same sequence without skipping any or regressing to earlier ones
2) The stages are also the same for everyone irrespective of culture (they’re universal).
3) Underlying the changes are certain functional invariants, fundamental aspects of the developmental process
which remain the same and work in the same way through the various stages. The most important of these are
assimilation and accommodation.
4) The principal cognitive structure that changes is the schema (plural schemas or schemata).

Assimilation and accommodation
◦ Assimilation is the process of taking in new information and fitting it into existing
schemas (mental categories) without changing those schemas.
◦ E.g. A child knows about dogs: they’re furry, have four legs, and bark. When the child sees a cat for the
first time, they might call it a “dog” because it also has four legs and fur. The child is assimilating the new
animal into their existing “dog” schema.

◦ Accommodation is the process of modifying existing schemas or creating new ones
when new information doesn’t fit the old schema.
◦ E.g. After being corrected that the cat is not a dog, the child learns that cats meow and have different
behaviors. The child then creates a new “cat” schema separate from “dog.” This is accommodation —
adjusting the schema to include new distinctions.

Stages of cognitive development
(Piaget, 1952)

Sensorimotor Stage
◦ 0-2 yrs
◦ Infants understand their world primarily through sensory experiences
and physical (motor) interactions with objects
◦ Object Permanence: the understanding that an object continues to
exist even when it cannot be seen
◦ Piaget claimed that infants younger than 9 months do not have a
mental representation of objects

Object permanence

Pre-operational stage
◦ 2-7 yrs
◦ The world is represented symbolically through words and mental images; no understanding of basic mental
operations or rules
• No understanding of Principle of Conservation: basic properties of objects stay the same even though their
outward appearance may change e.g. water in differently shaped glasses
• Egocentrism: difficulty in viewing the world from someone else’s perspective e.g. three mountains task
• Irreversibility: cannot mentally reverse actions e.g. pouring back the water into glass A
• Animism: the belief that inanimate objects are capable of actions and have lifelike qualities e.g. the sidewalk
was mad and made them fall down

Example: Principle of Conservation

Example: Egocentrism

Example: Irreversibility

The child cannot mentally reverse the action and understand that the water
could be poured back to look the same..

Example: Animism

Concrete operational stage
◦ 7-11 yrs
◦ The child is now capable of performing logical operations, but only in the presence of
actual objects. They can conserve, and show reversibility and more logical
classification. They are less ego-centric.
◦ One remaining problem for the concrete operational child is transitivity tasks. For
example, if told that ‘Alan is taller than Nigel, and Nigel is taller than Charlie’ and
asked whether Alan or Charlie is taller, children under 11 cannot solve this problem
entirely in their heads. They can usually only solve it using real (or concrete) objects
(such as dolls).

Formal operational stage
◦ 11 + yrs
◦ Children are able to think logically and systematically about both
concrete and abstract problems, form hypotheses, and test them in a
thoughtful way

An alternative model?
◦ Vygotsky, in contrast to Piaget (and the
information-processing approach), sees
the child as a participant in an
interactive process, by which socially –
and culturally – determined knowledge
and understanding gradually become
individualised.
