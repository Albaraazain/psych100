WHAT IS INTELLIGENCE?

HOW WOULD YOU DEFINE
INTELLIGENCE?

“A VERY GENERAL MENTAL CAPABILITY THAT INVOLVES
THE ABILITY TO REASON, PLAN, SOLVE PROBLEMS,
THINK ABSTRACTLY, COMPREHEND COMPLEX IDEAS,
LEARN QUICKLY, AND LEARN FROM EXPERIENCE.”

THEORIES OF INTELLIGENCE


Spearman’s two-factor theory (1904)


All intellectual activities share a
common underlying factor (g), along
with specific factors (s) unique to
each task. So performance on any
mental task depends on how intelligent
you are overall (g) plus how skilled you
are in that specific area (s).



There is a single general intelligence
(g) that influences performance on
every cognitive task.



There are also many specific abilities
(s) unique to each task.

THEORIES OF INTELLIGENCE (CONT.)
 Fluid and Crystallized Intelligence theory of

Cattell (gf-gc theory)
 Cattell (1963) argue that g can be subdivided

into two major dimensions – fluid and crystallized
intelligence.
 Fluid intelligence (gf) - The ability to reason,

think abstractly, and solve novel problems—
independent of prior knowledge or experience.
 Crystallized intelligence (gc) - The ability to use

learned knowledge, skills, and experience. It
grows through education and cultural exposure.

THEORIES OF INTELLIGENCE (CONT.)

 Sternberg’s Theory
 Three types of intelligences

THEORIES OF INTELLIGENCE (CONT.)

 Gardner’s Theory
 Eight types of intelligences

INTELLIGENCE TESTING

 Standford-Binet test
 Wechsler tests
 Raven’s progressive matrices

THE STANDFORD-BINET TEST
 In 1904, Binet and Simon were commissioned by the French government to devise a test

which would identify those children who wouldn’t benefit from ordinary schooling because of
their lower intelligence.
 The result was the Simon–Binet test (1905), generally accepted as the first INDIVIDUAL

intelligence test.
 Revisions led to Standford-Binet test
 1986 – 4th revision and 2003 – 5th edition
 Verbal and nonverbal scales are balanced (based on gf-gc theory)
 Mean 100, SD 15
 Verbal IQ, nonverbal IQ, full-scale IQ

ARMY ALPHA AND ARMY BETA IQ TESTS
 These were the very first GROUP intelligence tests in history, developed in

1917–1919 by the U.S. Army to screen and classify over 1.7 million recruits
during World War I.
 Army Alpha - Designed for literate recruits (those who could read and write

English well).
 Army Beta - Designed for illiterate recruits or non-English speakers (mostly

recent immigrants from Southern/Eastern Europe and some African
Americans).

WECHSLER TESTS

 Balanced verbal and nonverbal scales
 The most commonly used IQ tests globally
 Most recent versions:
 Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence (WPPSI – IV, 2012) – 2.5 – 6 yrs old
 Wechsler Intelligence Scale Children (WISC – V, 2014) – 6-16 yrs old
 Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS-V, 2024) – 16-90 yrs old

RAVEN’S PROGRESSIVE MATRICES

 Raven’s Standard Progressive Matrices (SPM),

Advanced Progressive Matrices (APM), and Colored
Progressive Matrices (CPM for children) (Raven,
1938; 1998).
 Non-verbal
 Culture-reduced

GENDER DIFFERENCES IN IQ - GENDER

 Most IQ tests have been constructed so that there are no differences in scores between

genders
 Any difference between genders may only have been negligible (Terman, 1916)
 Meta-analyses reporting scores for men average 5 IQ points more than women (Irwing &
Lynn, 2005) have small effect sizes

GENDER DIFFERENCES IN IQ
 Males better on visuo-spatial tasks (e.g. mental rotation). Mean of male distribution on mental rotation

is almost one standard deviation above that for females (Masters and Sanders, 1993)
 Constructing models, furniture assembly

 Males also score higher on mechanical reasoning (e.g. Maintainig, repairing, operating equipment)

and quantitative tasks (maths)

 Females perform better than males on a number of verbal tasks, such as synonym generation, and

verbal fluency. Mean of female distribution is between 0.5 and 1.2 standard deviations above that of
males.

 Females may also perform better than males on some memory tasks.

WHY?
Biological:
•Brain size: Males have ~10% larger brains on average, correlating with ~0.3-0.4 IQ points per gram
(though females have higher neuronal density).
•Hormones: Prenatal testosterone exposure predicts better spatial skills and male-typical play;
estrogen supports verbal memory.
•Evolution: Hunter-gatherer hypothesis posits male spatial edges from navigation/hunting;
female verbal from social/child-rearing roles (supported by cross-cultural consistency).
Environmental:
•Socialization: Girls encouraged in language arts, boys in STEM toys (e.g., LEGO studies show early
gaps).
•Education: Gaps narrow in gender-equal societies (e.g., PISA data from Nordic countries), but highend math differences persist.
•Gender differentiated toys

GENDER DIFFERENCES IN IQ - RACE
 A number of studies (based in USA) have reported that some racial groups differ in

intelligence
 Jensen (1969) suggested that white children were more intelligent than black children, and
Asian children were more intelligent than either. He claimed that such differences were
largely due to genetic factors
 Herrnstein and Murray published The Bell Curve (1994), suggesting a difference of one
standard deviation between mean IQ scores of Blacks (mean = 85) and Whites (mean = 100)
in USA
 Herrnstein and Murray further suggested that the differences are genetic in origin

GENDER DIFFERENCES IN IQ - RACE
 American Psychological Association

assembled a task force to investigate
Herrnstein and Murray’s findings (see
handout Neisser et al., 1996)

 Task force agreed that there were

differences between average IQ scores
of African Americans and white
Americans, but suggest that differences
may be due to cultural factors.

WHY?

 Three possible explanations for race difference on IQ scores
 Test bias
 Genetics
 Environment

TEST BIAS

 This explanation posits that IQ tests are not neutral but reflect the cultural knowledge, language, and

experiences of the dominant group (typically White, middle-class Americans), disadvantaging minority groups.
Differences in scores, therefore, do not measure true intelligence but familiarity with test content.

GENETICS

 This view argues that racial groups have evolved genetic differences in cognitive abilities due to historical

selection pressures (e.g., climate, migration), leading to inherent IQ disparities
 Race is primarily a social construct, not a biological one; No genes for "intelligence" have been identified that

differ systematically by race.
 Nisbett, R. E., et al. (2012). "Intelligence: New findings and theoretical developments." American Psychologist,

67(6), 503–504.

ENVIRONMENT

 This dominant explanation attributes gaps to unequal access to resources, education, health, and opportunity,

which shape cognitive development from prenatal stages onward. Racial categories proxy for systemic
inequities (e.g., racism, poverty).
 While all three explanations have been proposed, the overwhelming scientific consensus is that

environmental factors, compounded by historical and ongoing inequities, account for nearly all racial
IQ differences.

THE FLYNN EFFECT
 IQ has increased over time, on average around 3

IQ points per decade
 Largest gains in fluid intelligence (reasoning,

pattern recognition—e.g., Raven’s Matrices), not
crystallized (vocabulary, facts).
 Observed in >30 countries, including developing

nations.
 Slowing or reversing in some developed nations

(Norway, Denmark, UK) since the late 1990s.

WHY?
 Nutrition: Better prenatal and childhood nutrition → brain growth
 Education: Longer schooling, abstract thinking training
 Cognitive Stimulation: TV, puzzles, video games, VR
 Smaller families: More parental attention per child
 Test familiarity: Practice with multiple-choice, abstract problems

HEREDITY OR ENVIRONMENT?
 Both heredity and environment contribute to intelligence
 Heredity and environment interact in various ways
 As people’s genetic similarity increases, generally so does the similarity of their

environments. This can be overcome by comparing the IQs of Monozygotics reared
together with those raised apart.
 MZsRA are still more similar than same-sex Dizygotics reared together, suggesting a strong

genetic influence.
 However, studies of MZsRA have been criticized on several important methodological

grounds.
 Further support for the influence of genetic factors comes from adoption studies. But when

children from disadvantaged parents are adopted into high SES families, substantial gains in
IQ can occur.
