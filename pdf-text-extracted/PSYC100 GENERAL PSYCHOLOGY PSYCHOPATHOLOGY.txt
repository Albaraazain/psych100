What is abnormality?
• Abnormality as deviation from the (statistical) average
• Gifted are statistically rare, is that abnormal?
• Common things like anxiety are considered as disorders.

• Abnormality as deviation from the norm
• Society’s norms; is rule breaking is bad, then is having panic attack also
bad?

• Abnormality as deviation from ideal mental health
• Varies across cultures

What is abnormality?
• Abnormality as personal distress
• Obsessive-compulsive behaviour

• Abnormality as others’ stress
• Interpersonal aspect; narcissistic personality disorder

• Abnormality as maladaptiveness
• Substance use

• Abnormality as unexpected behaviour
• Anxiety in anxiety disorders is out of proportion

The classification of mental
disorders
• Kraepelin published the first recognised textbook of psychiatry in
1883. Kraepelin claimed that certain groups of symptoms occur
together sufficiently often for them to be called a ‘disease’ or
syndrome.
• His classification formed the basis for the Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) and the
International Classification of Diseases (ICD).

Example: Major depressive disorder
A person must experience at least 5 symptoms during the same 2-week period, and the
symptoms must represent a change from previous functioning. At least one of the symptoms
must be: depressed mood or loss of interest/pleasure.
1. Depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day
2. Markedly reduced interest or pleasure in most activities
3. Significant unintentional weight loss or gain, or change in appetite
4. Insomnia or hypersomnia
5. Observable psychomotor agitation or slowing
6. Fatigue or loss of energy
7. Feelings of worthlessness or excessive/inappropriate guilt
8. Reduced ability to think, concentrate, or make decisions
9. Recurrent thoughts of death, suicidal ideation, or suicide attempt
• The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or
other important areas of functioning.

Separation Anxiety Disorder

Anxiety
disorders

Selective Mutism
Specific Phobia

Social Anxiety Disorder (Social Phobia)
Panic Disorder
Agoraphobia
Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)

Separation anxiety
disorder
• Characterized by excessive fear or distress about
being separated from major attachment figures.
• Symptoms may include persistent worry about
harm happening to them, reluctance to leave
home, nightmares about separation, or physical
complaints when separation is anticipated.

Selective mutism
• Marked by a consistent failure to speak in specific
social situations (e.g., school) despite speaking
normally in other settings.
• Not due to lack of language knowledge,
developmental delay, or other communication
disorders. Often associated with social anxiety.

Specific phobia
• Involves intense fear or anxiety triggered by a
specific object or situation (such as claustrophobia,
animals, heights, flying, blood/injection/injury, etc.).
• Exposure nearly always provokes anxiety, leading
to avoidance or enduring with intense distress.
• Fear is excessive relative to actual danger.

Social anxiety disorder
• A persistent fear of social situations where one
may be judged, embarrassed, or scrutinized.
• Common triggers include conversations, meeting
new people, public speaking, or eating in front of
others.
• Leads to avoidance or intense distress and
interferes with functioning.

Panic disorder
• Defined by recurrent, unexpected panic attacks,
along with persistent worry about additional attacks
or their consequences, and/or significant
maladaptive behaviour changes (e.g., avoidance).

Agoraphobia
• Fear or anxiety about being in situations where
escape might be difficult or help unavailable in
case of panic-like symptoms.
• Common situations: public transportation, open
spaces, enclosed places, crowds, or being outside
the home alone.
• People may avoid these situations or need a
companion.

Generalized anxiety
disorder
• Chronic, excessive worry about multiple areas of
life (work, health, finances, family, etc.) occurring
more days than not for at least 6 months.
• The person cannot pinpoint the source of anxiety.

Obsessivecompulsive
Body
Dysmorphic Disorder
and related
Hoarding Disorder
disorders

Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)

Trichotillomania (Hair-Pulling Disorder)
Excoriation (Skin-Picking) Disorder

Obsessive-compulsive disorder
• A condition involving obsessions, compulsions, or both.
• Obsessions: intrusive, unwanted thoughts, urges, or images that
cause anxiety.
• Compulsions: repetitive behaviours or mental acts performed to
neutralize the anxiety or prevent a feared event.
• Symptoms are time-consuming or impair functioning.
• The person recognizes the thoughts/behaviours as excessive, though
insight can vary.
• E.g. cleaning, checking, symmetry etc.

Body dysmorphic disorder
• Characterized by a preoccupation with perceived defects or flaws in
physical appearance that are minor or not observable to others.
• Individuals engage in repetitive behaviours (e.g., mirror checking,
excessive grooming, skin picking) or mental acts (comparing
appearance to others).
• Causes significant distress or impairment; may involve muscle
dysmorphia.

Hoarding disorder
• Marked by persistent difficulty discarding or parting with possessions,
regardless of actual value.
• This leads to accumulation of clutter that congests living areas and
compromises use of space.
• Attempts to discard items cause significant distress.
• Not explained by lack of space or poverty.

Trichotillomania (Hair-Pulling
Disorder)
• Recurrent pulling out of one’s hair, leading to noticeable hair loss.
• Individuals have repeated attempts to decrease or stop the behaviour.
• Often linked to tension before pulling and relief afterward, though this
pattern can vary.

Excoriation (Skin-Picking) Disorder
• Recurrent skin picking that results in skin lesions.
• Repeated efforts are made to reduce or stop picking.
• Leads to distress, medical complications, or impairment in social or
occupational functioning.

Depressive
and Bipolar
Persistent Depressive Disorder
disorders
Major Depressive Disorder

Bipolar I
Bipolar II

Major Depressive Disorder
• A condition marked by persistent depressed mood or loss of interest,
along with other symptoms such as changes in sleep, appetite, energy,
concentration, or thoughts of self-harm.
• Symptoms last at least 2 weeks and cause significant distress or
impairment.

Persistent Depressive Disorder
• A chronic, long-lasting form of depression with a low mood that persists
for 2 years or more (1 year in children/adolescents).
• Symptoms are less severe than MDD but more enduring, often with low
energy, poor self-esteem, and hopelessness.

Bipolar I
• Defined by at least one manic episode, which is a period of
abnormally elevated, expansive, or irritable mood with increased energy
and impaired functioning.
• Depressive episodes often occur but are not required for diagnosis.
• Causes marked impairment, may include psychosis, or require
hospitalization.

Bipolar II
• Characterized by recurring hypomanic episodes (a milder form of
mania that does not cause severe impairment) and major
depressive episodes.
• No history of full manic episodes.
• No marked impairment, no psychosis, and no hospitalization due
to hypomania.

Schizophrenia

Schizophrenia
Schizophreniform Disorder
spectrum
Schizoaffective Disorder
Brief Psychotic Disorder
Delusional Disorder

Schizophrenia
• A chronic disorder with persistent psychotic symptoms
(delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech/behaviour,
negative symptoms) lasting ≥6 months, with significant decline
in functioning.
• Symptoms tend to be long-term and disabling without treatment.

Psychotic symptoms in
schizophrenia
Delusions: false beliefs that are sustained in the face of
evidence that normally would be sufficient to destroy them
 Hallucinations: false perceptions that have a compelling
sense of reality (mostly auditory)
 Disorganized thought and language


 Nonsensical, rhyming patterns i.e. clanging



Affects emotional expression

 Blunt, flat, or inappropriate affect

Delusions
• Persecutory delusions: Belief of being harmed, watched, or targeted by others.
• Delusions of reference: Belief that neutral events or media have special personal
significance.
• Grandiose delusions: Belief of having exceptional power, wealth, identity, or abilities.
• Delusions of control: Belief that one’s thoughts, feelings, or actions are controlled by
external forces.
• Thought delusions: Including thought insertion, thought withdrawal, or thought
broadcasting.
• Somatic delusions: False beliefs about bodily functions or physical abnormalities.
• Nihilistic delusions: Belief that oneself, others, or the world does not exist or has
ended.

Clanging
TH: ‘What colour is your dress?’
CL: ‘Red . . . Like a bed.’
TH: ‘Why is it like a bed?’
CL: ‘Because it’s dead.’
TH: ‘Why is a bed like being dead?’
CL: ‘I dunno . . . maybe it’s a med.’
TH: ‘What’s a med?’
CL: ‘A bled.’

Schizophreniform Disorder
• Same symptom pattern as schizophrenia but with a duration of
1–6 months.
• Functioning may be impaired but long-term impairment is not
required. Can progress to schizophrenia if symptoms persist.

Schizoaffective Disorder
• Features both psychotic symptoms and mood
episodes (major depressive or manic).

Example
• A 28-year-old individual presents with a two-year history of
auditory hallucinations and persecutory delusions, accompanied
by recurrent major depressive episodes and periods of elevated
mood with decreased need for sleep and increased goal-directed
activity.

Brief Psychotic Disorder
• A sudden onset of psychotic symptoms (delusions,
hallucinations, disorganized speech/behaviour) lasting 1 day
to <1 month, followed by full return to baseline.
• Often triggered by stress

Example
• A 24-year-old college student, after a heated argument with her
roommate and failing two exams, suddenly becomes convinced that
the FBI is monitoring her through her laptop camera and that
classmates are government agents sent to poison her food. She is
seen talking to herself, screaming at “agents” in the hallway, and
appears terrified. She barely sleeps for 5 days. After 12 days, with lowdose antipsychotic medication and supportive therapy, the beliefs and
hallucinations completely disappear, and she returns fully to her
baseline, with good insight that it was related to extreme stress.

Delusional Disorder
• Marked by one or more delusions lasting ≥1 month, with
otherwise relatively normal functioning.

Erotomanic type A 45-year-old woman
believes that a famous actor she has never met
is secretly in love with her. She interprets his
TV interviews as containing coded love
messages directed only to her. She mails him
letters and once traveled to his city to “meet
him at the airport.” Apart from this fixed belief,
she works full-time as an accountant, dresses
appropriately, and has normal conversations.

Examples

Persecutory type (most common) A 58year-old man is convinced for the past 3 years
that his neighbors have installed hidden
microphones in his apartment walls and are
recording him to blackmail him. He has filed
multiple police reports and covered his walls
with aluminum foil. He still goes to work every
day as a bus driver and has no hallucinations
or bizarre behavior outside this belief system.

Somatic type A 38-year-old woman is
absolutely certain she has a parasitic worm
infestation in her intestines despite dozens
of negative medical tests (stool tests, CT
scans, colonoscopies). She spends hours a
day researching rare parasites online and
repeatedly demands antiparasitic
medication. Functioning is fairly intact
otherwise.

Examples

Jealous type A 50-year-old husband
believes, without evidence, that his wife has
been unfaithful with multiple colleagues for
the past 2 years. He checks her phone
daily, follows her car, and questions minor
details in her stories, but does not have
mood swings, hallucinations, or
disorganized thinking.

Cluster A
1. Paranoid Personality Disorder: Believes others are exploiting, harming, or deceiving
them (without evidence) – Preoccupied with unjustified doubts about loyalty of
friends/colleagues – Reluctant to confide in others (fears information will be used against

Ideas of reference (not full delusions) e.g. Van Gogh

Examples
Paranoid Personality Disorder
A 35-year-old employee persistently suspects coworkers are undermining him despite no evidence. He
interprets neutral comments as hostile, holds longstanding grudges, and avoids confiding in others due to
fears of betrayal. Functioning is limited by pervasive mistrust.
Schizoid Personality Disorder

pleasure from activities. Affect is constricted, and the person appears indifferent to praise or criticism.
Occupational functioning is adequate in solitary work settings.
Schizotypal Personality Disorder

can sense others’ thoughts). Speech is vague and metaphorical, with limited close relationships.
Perceptual distortions and magical thinking interfere with social and occupational functioning.

Cluster B
4. Antisocial Personality Disorder: Pervasive disregard for others’ rights, deceitful,
impulsive, aggressive, reckless, zero remorse. “Con artists” or criminals who feel no guilt. E.g.
Ted Bundy
5. Borderline Personality Disorder: Unstable mood, self-image, and relationships;
terror of abandonment; rapid mood swings; chronic emptiness; recurrent self-harm or suicidal
behaviour; impulsive (spending, sex, substances). “Emotional burn victims” — everything feels
life-or-death. E.g. Amy Winehouse, Marilyn Monroe
6. Histrionic Personality Disorder: Constant attention-seeking, overly
dramatic/theatrical, shallow and rapidly shifting emotions, sexually seductive or provocative
behaviour, uncomfortable when not the centre of attention. E.g. Madonna, Johnny Depp
7. Narcissistic Personality Disorder: Grandiosity, fantasies of unlimited
success/power, believes they are “special,” needs excessive admiration, entitlement,
exploitative, lacks empathy, envious of others or believes others envy them. Fragile selfesteem hidden behind arrogance. E.g. Kanye West, Donald Trump, Steve Jobs

Examples

A 30-year-old individual has a history of repeated arrests, deceitfulness, and impulsive behavior since
adolescence. They demonstrate disregard for others’ rights, lack remorse for harm caused, and fail to sustain
employment or relationships.
Borderline Personality Disorder

reactivity. They report chronic feelings of emptiness, engage in self-harming behavior during interpersonal
stress, and alternate between idealizing and devaluing others.
Histrionic Personality Disorder
A 32-year-old individual displays excessive emotionality, attention-seeking behavior, and discomfort when not
the focus of attention. Speech is impressionistic, behavior is sexually provocative, and relationships are
perceived as more intimate than they are.

delegating impossible unless done exactly their way. E.g. Elon Musk

Examples
Avoidant Personality Disorder
A 29-year-old individual avoids social and occupational interactions due to intense fear of criticism
and rejection. Despite a strong desire for connection, they perceive themselves as socially
inadequate and engage only in situations where acceptance is assured.
Dependent Personality Disorder
A 34-year-old individual demonstrates excessive need to be cared for, leading to submissive and
clinging behavior. They have difficulty making decisions without reassurance, fear being alone,
and remain in unhealthy relationships to avoid abandonment.
Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder
