What is memory?
Memory, like learning, is a hypothetical construct denoting three distinguishable
but interrelated processes:
● registration (or encoding) – the transformation of sensory input (such as a
sound or visual image) into a form which allows it to be entered into (or
registered in) memory.
● storage – the operation of holding or retaining information in memory.
● retrieval – the process by which stored information is extracted from memory.

These three processes work to manage how we
encode, retain, and recall information in our
memory.


Registration (Encoding): This is the initial step where sensory information is
transformed into a format that can be stored in memory. It involves selective
attention and relates to questions like "How is sensory information processed in a
way that allows it to be stored?" or "How are things remembered?"



Storage: This process involves retaining information in memory over time. It relates
to questions such as "Where are our memories kept?" and "Is there more than one
kind of memory?"



Retrieval: This is the process of recovering stored information when needed. It
connects to questions like "Are there different kinds of remembering?" "What do we
remember?" and "Why do we forget?"

I - ENCODING (REGISTRATION)
Some information is encoded automatically without us being aware of it. Most
people probably can recall what they had for breakfast yesterday, even though
they haven’t tried to remember it. Other information will only become encoded if
you pay attention to it.
There are three ways of encoding information to be used by our memory system:
➢ acoustic encoding – encoding of sound
➢ visual encoding – encoding of picture images
➢ semantic encoding – encoding of meaning

Examples
Acoustic Encoding: If you are repeating someone’s phone number aloud.
Visual Encoding: Picturing the face of someone you met or imagining the
layout of a room you visited.
Semantic Encoding: Understanding and recalling that "justice" means fairness
or remembering the concept of "photosynthesis" as how plants make food.

II - STORAGE


There are 3 forms of storage:

1. Sensory memory - This is the initial stage where sensory information (sight, sound,
etc.) is briefly held for a very short period, typically less than a second to a few seconds. It
acts as a buffer, allowing us to process and decide what to pay attention to.
2. Short-term memory - This holds information for a limited time, usually 20-30 seconds,
and has a small capacity (about 5-9 items). It’s where we actively think about or manipulate
information, like remembering a phone number long enough to dial it.
3. Long-term memory - This stores information for an extended period, potentially a
lifetime, with a vast capacity. It includes knowledge, skills, and experiences, and is
accessed when we recall past events or learned facts.

STM vs LTM
●

capacity – how much information can be stored

●

duration – how long the information can be held in storage

●

coding – how sensory input is represented by the memory system.

Short-term memory CAPACITY
 George Miller (1956) emphasized that the capacity of the STM is

approximately “seven plus or minus two” pieces of information – digits,
words etc. (the magic number 7+/-2).

Short-term memory CAPACITY
Chunking of information can lead to an increase in the STM capacity. This
is the reason why a hyphenated phone number is EASIER to remember
than a single long number.

Short-term memory DURATION
The duration of STM is thought to be 15-30 seconds. If information is not
rehearsed within 18 to 30 seconds whilst in STM, it is lost due to its limited
duration. Short-term memory encodes information acoustically through
repetition of information. If we rehearse (repeat) this information (say it over
and over to ourselves), we can store it in our short-term memory for many
minutes and it can then be transferred to the long-term memory store (almost
indefinitely) (Peterson & Peterson, 1959).

Short-term memory CODING
 Mainly acoustic (e.g. When you try to remember a phone

number by repeating it in your head); Some semantic
(encoding by meaning); Visual is also possible (e.g. briefly
remembering an image or shape.)

Long-term memory CAPACITY &
DURATION
The capacity of LTM could be unlimited as it can hold a potentially
unlimited amount of information.
Duration: Long-term memory can store memories for minutes or up to an
entire lifetime.

Long-term memory CODING
Encoding in long-term memory is largely semantic (e.g. You remember that “a
whale is a mammal” because of what it means, not how it sounds), but can be
visual (e.g. remembering what your childhood home looks like) or acoustic
(e.g. remembering the tune of a favorite song).

RETRIEVAL
Retrieval refers to getting information out of storage. If we
cannot remember something, it may be because we are unable
to retrieve it.
e.g. Ebbinghaus study (1885)
e.g. Standing study (1973)

The Multi-Store Model (MSM)
Richard Atkinson and Richard Shiffrin developed the Multi-store Model of Memory
(1968) by drawing conclusions from memory experiments conducted by other
researchers. This model is a structural model and Atkinson and Shiffrin described
memory as having separate stores.
By pulling together this research, they were able to identify three distinctly different
stores in our memory system:
• the sensory register (or sensory memory)
• short-term memory
• long-term memory

The Multi-Store Model (MSM)
Atkinson and Shiffrin proposed
that memory stores differ from
each other in the way
information is encoded, their
capacity and duration, and how
information is retrieved.

Experimental studies of STM and LTM
1. Experimental studies of STM and LTM
2. Studies of coding
3. Studies of brain-damaged patients.

1. Experimental studies of STM and
LTM
The Serial Position Effect (Murdock, 1962): Participants typically recalled
those items from the end of the list first, and got more of these correct than
earlier items (the recency effect). Items from the beginning of the list were
recalled quite well relative to those in the middle (the primacy effect), but not as
well as those at the end. Poorest recall is for items in the middle.
Primacy effect due to LTM, recency effect due to STM.

2. Studies of coding
Remember acoustic coding in STM, semantic coding in LTM!
However, Miller and Selfridge (1950) has demonstrated that knowledge of
semantic and grammatical structure (presumably stored in LTM) is used to aid
recall from STM. Therefore, an acoustic code isn’t the only one used in STM.

3. Studies of brain-damaged patients.
If STM and LTM really are distinct, then there should be certain kinds of brain damage which
impair one without affecting the other. One such form of brain damage is anterograde amnesia.
HM case where after the brain operation, he was unable to form new explicit long-term
memories, however his immediate or working memory remained functional (STM intact, old LTM
intact, new LTM severely impaired).
HM's deficits strongly support the MSM by demonstrating a clear dissociation between STM and
LTM, suggesting they are separate systems

Episodic, Semantic & Procedural
Memory
 The multi-store model of memory, as supported by cases like HM,

distinguishes between short-term and long-term memory, with
long-term memory (LTM) further divided into subtypes based on
the type of information stored and how it is retrieved. The three
main types of long-term memory are episodic, semantic, and
procedural.

Episodic Memory
 The storage and recall of personally experienced events tied to specific times and

places. These are autobiographical memories that include contextual details (e.g.,
"what," "when," "where," and associated emotions). It is a type of explicit (declarative)
memory, meaning it can be consciously recalled and described.
 Autobiographical episodic memory - Personal, specific events from one’s life with
rich contextual details (e.g., Recalling your first day of university, what your lecturer
looked like, and how you felt.)
 Flashbulb Memories: Highly vivid, detailed memories of emotionally significant
events (e.g., Recalling how you felt when you found out about the death of a celebrity
or leader (e.g., Michael Jackson, Princess Diana).

Semantic Memory
 Involves the storage of general knowledge, facts, and concepts not

tied to personal experiences or specific contexts. It is also an
explicit (declarative) memory type, consciously recalled, but lacks
the temporal and spatial specificity of episodic memory.
 e.g. knowing that 2+2=4 or that "cat" refers to a furry animal

Procedural Memory
 Involves the unconscious recall of skills, habits, and motor routines

learned through practice. It is a type of implicit (non-declarative)
memory, meaning it is expressed through performance rather than
conscious recollection.
 e.g. riding a bicycle, chess player recognizing patterns, brushing

teeth in the morning,

The Working Memory Model (WMM)







Baddeley & Hitch (1974; 2000) - this model focuses on how
short-term memory (STM) actually works in practice. Instead
of being just a “storage box,” it’s seen as an active system
that manipulates and processes information.
Central executive: Acts like a manager; Directs attention
and coordinates the other subsystems; Has limited capacity.
Phonological Loop: stores spoken words for a short time;
allows rehearsal
Visuo-Spatial Sketchpad: Holds and manipulates images
Episodic Buffer: Integrates information from different
sources (sound, vision, long-term memory) into a single
“episode.”

MSM vs WMM
 Multi-Store Model - STM is a single, passive store; focus on the structure of

memory (where info goes); Simple, linear, “box-like” model.

 e.g. remembering a shopping list - You hear the list of items → it enters sensory memory →

you rehearse it in STM (silently repeat “milk, eggs, bread”) → with enough rehearsal, it
transfers to LTM.

 Working-Memory Model - STM is an active system with multiple components;

focus on the process of memory (how info is handled); More detailed and dynamic
model.
 e.g. remembering a shopping list - Phonological Loop: you repeat “milk, eggs, bread” in your

head; Central Executive: focuses your attention and tells you not to get distracted; Episodic
Buffer: links “milk” with the image of the fridge at home being empty.

The Levels of Processing Model (LOP)
 Remember MSM argues we need to reherse the information in order to

transfer it from STM to LTM. However, Jenkins (1974) Incidental learning
- remembering without rehersing. Craik and Lockhart (1972) argues what
matters is the kind of rehearsal or processing.
 So, rather than rehearsal in STM, you can achieve LTM via deep,
semantic processing.


e.g. If you’re trying to remember the word “elephant”:

MSM → You repeat “elephant” in STM until it transfers to LTM.
LOP → You think about what an elephant looks like, how big it is, or connect it with the zoo
(semantic processing), which makes it memorable.

Key evidence LOP
Craik & Tulving (1975): Participants were given a list of words, but instead of being asked to
memorize them, they answered different kinds of questions about each word. The questions
encouraged different levels of processing:
Shallow (structural) → e.g., “Is the word in capital letters?”
Intermediate (phonemic) → e.g., “Does the word rhyme with ‘cat’?”
Deep (semantic) → e.g., “Does the word fit in this sentence: ‘The ____ walked into the room’?”
•

After answering these questions, participants were given a surprise recognition test (asked which
words they had seen before).

•

Words processed at a deep, semantic level were remembered much better than words processed
at shallow or phonemic levels. Depth of processing, not just rehearsal, determines how well
information is remembered (STRONG EVIDENCE AGAINST MSM!).

Theories of Forgetting


Forgetting can occur at the encoding, storage or retrieval stages.



What prevents information staying in STM long enough to be transferred to LTM?


Decay theory: Suggests that memories fade over time if they are not accessed or rehearsed (STM + LTM)



Displacement theory: new incoming information pushes out older information as we exceed the limited capacity of
STM



Interference theory: forgetting occurs when new or old information disrupts the recall of other memories (LTM).
There are two types:
 Proactive Interference: When old information interferes with learning or remembering new information. For

example, if you used to have an old phone number and it keeps popping into your mind when you try to recall
your new one AND Learning a new password is harder because your old password keeps coming to mind..
 Retroactive Interference: When new information interferes with the ability to recall older information. For

instance, learning a new language might make it harder to remember vocabulary from a previously learned
language AND You learn new dance steps, then forget some of the old ones..

Efficient forgetting?
 According

to Schacter (2002),
efficient forgetting is a crucial part of
having a fully functioning memory;
this is lacking in people with
hyperthymestic syndrome (or highly
superior
autobiographical
memory/HSAM).
